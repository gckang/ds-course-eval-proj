"I don't really understand the complexities between what needs to be known in the textbook, Colander, and what Elzinga believes.The grading for exams are also incredibly harsh and vary TA to TA, which makes it difficult to do very well, especially on short answerbased exams."
"I really enjoyed Professor Elzinga's lectures, they were always interesting and well organized, and despite what last year's studentsmight have said I felt like they went by quickly because they were never boring. I thought the test questions in general were relevantand fair."
El Zinga's the goat.
"I feel like the course material is covered in khan academy, which is helpful, but the lectures I feel like are not as helpful.The lectures are not as demonstrative. The graphs aren't drawn for us. And I feel like unnecessary topics were covered."
It was a positive experience.
Interesting concepts but not applied very well
Professor Elzinga is a great lecturer and very engaging (but I'm sure you already know that).
Professor Elzinga is awesome and really cares about his students! Great course.
My experience could have been improved by being provided with answer keys to practice tests the TAs handed out before midterms.
"Going in, I was dreading taking economics and I just wanted to get through it and do well as a prerequisite. Now I actually find It veryinteresting!"
I enjoyed this course a lot and it made me want to major in economics.
I thoroughly enjoyed this course
solid experience
"I enjoyed the course overall, however the large midterm exam model created a lot of stress due to time constraints and how thequestions were phrased."
It was great! Made me feel interested in economics and invested in the course concepts
"I was always a high achiever in high school and everything I did came natural. I came to college thinking it was not going to be toodifferent. Consequently, I was wrong because this class showed me that I am not always going to have the advantage, rather attimes with a disadvantage. Either that comes with not having the best resources like the better TA, or more help from any resourceavailable. I would not want to change anything but would rather just say thank you to allowing me to have to study harder andsmarter. It was a learning experience to really dive deep into the topics that I have not done in the past. This course is one of thecourses where you know it or you do not and if you do not, you must make the decision to come to like studying. It made mebecome obsessed at times to learn every single detail which I hated and loved at the same time. When I speak about the course, Ihave more things to say about what lessons I learned in my growth as a student rather than just the content. It made me go throughchallenges that I learned from that will last a lifetime. Thank you Mr. Elzinga."
"I would like the instructor and the university administrators to know that they should continue running the course. Onerecommendation, though, is to put more emphasis on the externalities section during lecture."
–
it is too exam heavy
"My overall experience was solid, there is not much to complain about. I enjoyed Elzinga's lectures and the humor he applies to thelessons. My only piece of advice is that it would appreciate if the TA provided more review problems and set questions becausethere have been times where other students received content from their TAs."
"Good experience, professor who is enthusiastic about teaching and made he topics interesting."
It was great.
"I didn't exactly know what to expect from Econ since I hadn't taken it in high school before coming to UVA, but it wasn't as bad as Ithought."
"i gained a sound understanding of basic micro concepts, thank you"
This is a great course and should continue to be taught by Mr. Elzinga.
"I enjoyed how professor Elzinga appealed to all the students with different interests. I also found it very encouraging that he actuallyread the class guestbook."
review old lectures before exams.
"I really learned a lot about economics! I didn't want to take this class because I didn't think it would interest me, but I am glad I didbecause I feel like it is a generally good life skill to have. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the course as well."
Aviva Teller is the best. Super great TA. Always there to help and answer questions.
"The lecture itself was fine, but sometimes it was difficult to know what was important and what was not since most of the slides hadno words and just images."
"I think that if there were more resources like study groups, more worksheets that allowed you to practice and things like that wouldhelp a lot. I felt that reading the textbook did not allow me to learn a lot. Instead in person with someone stepping me through thegraphs was really how i grasped it. Due to class constraints I was not able to make office hours in the last stretch. As well as my TAcanceled most of the discussions right before the final. This makes me extremely nervous for me outcome."
I really enjoyed it.
"Record lectures, and post lecture slides with notes!"
This was literally my favorite class this semester!
It was just like the description
It was enjoyable. Reinforced my existing economic thought.
It was as amazing as everyone said.
"I loved this course, though challenging at times. I have gained a much larger understanding of the material."
"The lectures are what you make of them and you will learn as much as you choose to pay attention to . The discussion sections arewhat really help you drill in the material and having a good TA is really important."
I liked it a lot and might become an econ major
"I enjoyed this lecture, the textbook and lecture have a lot of repetition, though that is to be expected"
"This course provided a clear presentation of introductory economics in a way that was comprehensible even for students who haveno prior experience with economics courses."
"Although I had little interest beforehand, I now plan on continuing to study economics."
This was a great introductory level course.
I really enjoyed the course and want to continue taking economics classes.
sure
"It was great to take a class by Mr. Elzinga, but some of the specificity of the exam was unnecessarily challenging. It would have beenbetter to delve deeper into the material and make sure everyone really understands it than just lecture all day on examples of topicswe need to know."
The discussion really helps in practicing weekly concepts
it was interesting and taught in a way that made it less boring than it could have been.
i liked it
it was really good
"I enjoyed my time in Econ 201, and I would recommend the course to anyone regardless of their course of study"
"In general, I felt fairly neutral about this course itself. The structure of it was very straightforward and I liked how all expectations arereadily available in the syllabus, however, I did not feel like the material that was focused on most heavily in the lectures appearedon the exam."
I enjoyed this course a lot and appreciate the interesting nature of the lectures
"Mr. Elzinga is very nice and his lectures provide good examples. However, I think more of the focus during lecture being on coursematerial would benefit the class, as a didn't know what the best thing was to take away from lecture that would be beneficial topreparing for the tests."
"Overall I think this was very engaging, thoughtfully taught overview of basic economic concepts."
"Nothing really, maybe just that the lectures could have been a bit better explained? I had a bit of trouble paying attention sometimes"
This class was enjoyable and did greaten my interest in Economics. I liked Elzinga and found his lectures interesting.
It was good but it was hard.
"Nothing in particular, sometimes the lectures are slightly fast–paced but I didn't have any real problems."
"I thought the course was very well planned and thought out. Professor Elzinga's experience made lectures very interesting andstreamlined."
i oftentimes struggled to follow Prof Elzinga's train of thought
I really enjoyed this course and thought that the midterms reflected what we learned in class and the textbook perfectly.
"I enjoyed this course! Professor Elzinga taught us a lot not just about concepts and definitions, but also real world examples. Ithought all of the exams were fair, and I feel that I've learned a lot this semester."
Awesome class Elzinga is the best
I liked it so much I switched to be an Econ major.
"I thought it was a very interesting course, but increased accessibility and connection clarity between textbook and course materialwould be beneficial."
"Good overall. Oddly, the lectures are short. Not many evaluation opportunities."
I had a great time and learned a lot.
"This course was a great introductory course. Tests often had questions that didn't really follow what we learned in lecture, but otherthan that, it was great."
"I loved this course! I think Professor Elzinga is a great lecturer, and I really enjoyed attending class. I learned so much, and evendecided I'd like to double major in economics because of my experience in this class."
"I enjoyed the class as a whole and found Professor Elzingas teaching methods and the information I was able to take away fromthe lectures."
I had a great experience with the discussion in this course.
It’s very hard but interesting
I think the TA discussion sections were crucial to learning the material successfully.
Yes
I don’t know. I had a good time. Learned a lot.
"The lectures and textbook were both enjoyable but the examinations greatly impacted my experience in this course. I felt that theexaminations were wordy and reflected a higher level of understanding of Microeconomics that was not taught in lecture,discussion, or the textbook."
"The class is a proven, well–oiled machine and will always be successful. Elzinga is fantastic, though I am a student who learnsboth with what I see and what I hear and I found that sometimes what was shown on the board didn't necessarily connect with whatwas being discussed in the present moment of the lecture."
"I really do believe I gained a real–world understanding of microeconomics, and I am excited to see how I am capable of connectingEcon ideas to my life"
I enjoy it!
I loved it! I admire Professor Elzinga lots and feel very lucky to have gotten to take his course.
"I had a very positive experience with the lectures and discussions, though I had a very hard time with the exam style despiteattending class and studying"
"The TA sections across the board are very inconsistent with each TA grading and administering activities in a different way. Forexample, my TA posted the problem sets to complete and turn in, but a friend of mine had two chances to complete each problemset which allows for feedback."
"Overall, I liked the structure of the course and everything expected of us was pretty straightforward. I think sometimes there was littleto no overlap between the readings and the lecture presentation, so perhaps some sort of clearer outline about what is covered inclass vs. in the reading would be helpful."
"I had a great experience in this course, while already having some prior experience with microeconomics this course definitelyelevated my understanding of the applications of microecon"
"Sometime the questions on quizzes at end had not been talked about yet. Things like econ minutes should be posted todashboard."
"I enjoyed learning about your personal experiences in the consulting industry. Such examples really helped me picture and apply alot of the economic logic and kept me engaged."
"I really enjoyed this class, and as a result, am now considering a minor/major in Economics."
"made econ interesting to me, the lectures made it the most unappealing thing ever."
"I thoroughly enjoyed learning about economics and definitely feel that I gained a deeper understanding and love for the topic andthe economic way of thinking"
"I haven't performed very well in this class, and it's safe to say I have struggled with it. This, however, is not a reflection of how theclass is taught. I am interested in micro–economics, it just hasn't come super easy to me. Regardless, I am grateful for therecourses provided by this class that will hopefully lead to a passing grade."
I enjoyed the lectures and Elzinga's humor.
"This course was confusing and enlightening to me. I went from being someone who knew absolutely nothing about economics tohaving a solid understanding of the basics. However, I still have a lot to learn."
I have enjoyed learning more about economics.
"This was my first big college lecture, and Mr Elzinga seemed very aware that that was the case for most of his students. He wasvery understanding and helpful in assisting in the transition to college life and education."
I ADORED this course. Absolutely adored. Fantastic lectures; always so interesting and personal to students in the class.
"I am taking this course as a pre requisite for batten and it is very hard for me. I wish we had more grade opportunities on smallerassignments instead of the two huge exams that are very hard no matter how hard you prepare."
I would like him to know that I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures.
I enjoyed it!
I like the study of organized common sense so I enjoyed this course.
"It's a great course and Prof. Elzinga really knows his stuff. Sometimes it is hard to see what the main focus of his points are, but healways connects them back to a story which is helpful. Overall, the course is set up well."
"It was a good course overall, although lectures are a bit off topic at times."
"I feel so fortunate to have taken a class from Professor Elzinga. He is obviously very knowledgable about the content he teaches,and remains enthusiastic about every lecture. Justin Garrison has also been monumentally helpful throughout the semester. Hisreview sessions he holds have been a key aspect of my understanding of economics and I wish all TA's at UVA would hostsessions like his. It is also very obvious that Professor Elzinga and Justin Garrison really care about every single student that theyteach. The teaching staff ensures that this class surpasses simply obtaining a good letter grade and ensures that students whotake the course really understand the material."
I enjoyed it!
"I enjoy economics, but I found this course very hard. If there was a way I could meet with my discussion group twice a week I wouldtake the option to do that. It was very difficult for me to learn in the big lecture hall. Also lack on emphasis to pay attention to thereadings set me back."
"Despite the large lecture, Professor Elzinga was very helpful in understanding the material."
"I really liked this class, thank you!"
"I am grateful for the opportunity to learn about economics through this course. I enjoyed how both the professor and teacherassistants took the extra step to prepare students for examinations and learning. Examples include study sessions."
"I took microeconomics in high school, where I learned the same concepts and equations but I don't think it ever made practicalsense until Elzinga's class. I have a much deeper understanding and the capability to apply economic concepts to"
I really enjoyed the class because I felt like I learned more about the real world.
"I didn't like how the lectures were off topic from the textbook. I wish the course was more structured around the textbook becausethat is what the exams are structured around."
"It has been incredibly positive, setting a good foundation for Macro."
This is a good principles course that everybody should take at UVA.
"Professor Elzinga is an excellent professor and very interesting, so I am very glad that I was able to take a class with a legendaround UVA."
"This course was something I took as a pre requisite and I did enjoy the class but I find it very frustrating that I have no real way ofcalculating my score in the class until after the final. The TA and professor say to look at how well you did compared to the SD butthat isn't helpful in knowing how I am doing in the class for real."
"I have taken a microeconomics course before and done very well but for some reason, this time around I felt as though I had alower understanding of the course. I think this is because I had more hands–on practice in highschool than in this course."
I appreciated the lectures and the insightful analysis of economics provided by professor Elzinga
Too much lecturing. Too much excess information.
"Go over more topics in depth and maybe practice more exam like questions in the class so that we better prepare ourself for theexam."
This is the best course. It is approachable yet entertaining and definitely made me fall in love with Econ.
"I really enjoyed this course! The only suggestion I would have is to make lectures recorded as when I was sick, it was hard to catchup since I could only look at slides and not lectures."
"I really enjoyed the lectures, but I think some of the exam questions were meant to only confuse the students."
I enjoyed the lectures as they were interesting and many presented examples that are applicable today.
"I came in with no experience in economics, but I still thought the course was manageable. I liked the teaching style andpersonalization of the lectures, and learned a lot."
The discussions helped me understand the content on a greater level.
"It was a good course, but there should be recorder lectures, especially for the Tuesday before Thanksgiving."
I really enjoyed it.
"I really enjoyed this course, however I wish it was less lecture based and more hands on since the exam questions are allapplication based. (it would help to get more practice as a class)"
This class was very interesting as a whole.
"Overall I thought the course was structured well. Objectives and grading were clear, and I felt that I was given what I needed toprepare for exams."
i loved microecon and it reminded me of my time in macro in high school
"I really enjoyed this class, Mr.Elzinga made economics much more interesting and was always available for any questions I had"
I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures and I've found a new interest in econ through them.
"This course was excellent, and is a huge reason I intend to major in Economics :)"
"I loved this course and it really sparked my interest for economics, which I had never learned about in school before. ProfessorElzinga definitely conveyed his passion for the subject and that translated to a really interesting course."
"It was great, and was a unique way of teaching a critical topic."
It was fine.
This class opened my eyes to how facisnating Econ is.
"The learning is very self–involved. Most of my learning came from just reading the textbook, and some from lecture and nothing elsewhich is nothing to complain about."
The lecture material was difficult to learn but the discussion helped a lot.
I genuinely enjoyed taking Econ 201 as my first economics course.
Professor Elzinga is a compassionate and understanding teacher who cares about each of us despite the size of his classes.
"That it was a very tough, but rewarding course to this point."
"Although it was a huge class, I learned a lot."
Very plesent experience.
"Overall, the course met my expectations and I had a positive experience."
This class was a great introduction and explained concepts very well!
My expo experience was very bad and did not help me gain more understanding.
I really enjoyed Econ 201.
Lectures felt long
"Great course, but heavily focused on reading the textbook"
"I really enjoyed this class. Even though I struggled at times, the course was not so difficult that I could not keep up. I greatly enjoyedmy time in lecture, as I always felt engaged and interested. The Econ Minutes were my favorite, as it was great to see theseconcepts at play in real life."
"I thought that this was a great course and was very interesting. I thought that the content was taught very well by the professor andTA's. I did not really like that the tests make up almost your entire grade in the course, as one can do very poorly in the course fromjust one bad day, but overall I enjoyed this course."
I thought it was extremely structured and well paced.
"I really valued Justin, the head TA's lectures, I feel like they were more straightforward and easier to understand. Professor Elzingatends to tell long stories that do not always provide a simple explanation, but the lectures taught by Justin were extremely helpful."
"Sometimes the lectures were a little wandering through stories instead of content but they were interesting and engaging for themost part."
"Real time discussion session and real time small group discussion helped me a lot with my learning and understanding of thisclass. I think that small group discussion are the best way for a student to truely remember and understanding the class material.Indeed, in discussion session we can ask as many question as we want and always get an answer."
"In–class discussions and resources that were provided (textbook) went hand–in–hand with my learning experience which wasreally helpful. However, I think that for our discussion sections, it would be more helpful to follow along with the lectures."
"I enjoyed it. Wish there were other activities that were more engaging that could be seen as extra points, but also further myunderstanding of the course."
"The class did provide me with a lot of knowledge and what this information is like in the real world, which prepares me for my futureand others' futures. However, the class did get repetitive to the textbook so at times I would just be sitting there listening to theinformation I already knew from the textbook."
I think it was hard to focus in this large lecture compared to others
"I enjoyed learning in this course. Since it was such a large class I feel like grades were very subjective across different discussiongroups."
"It was a fun and interesting course, it was enjoyable but I would've liked to have to read less of the textbook."
The lectures were very interesting.
I had a positive experience in this course. It was my first business/economics class EVER and I'm very glad I took it.
"With a lecture so large I was really looking forward to my TA discussion to clarify and review material, however, I have been incrediblydisappointed with my discussion experience. The language barrier between the entire discussion and the TA made the 50–minuteperiod a waste of everyone's time. My TA was able to read directly from the slides, but once asked to elaborate or explain anothertopic, he could not articulate his thoughts clearly. I acknowledge that being a TA has probably been a fantastic experience for himand his English, however, my peers and I constantly grew frustrated with our discussion circumstances to the point where we wouldattend a random TA's office hours and only go to our discussion in order to take the weekly quiz."
"I had an overall nice experience. I believe this class is pretty straightforward. Obvious thing is, if you study the topic before thelecture, it will be easy to follow both the lecture and discussion, if not, it makes it far more difficult and you will fall behind. Mr. Elzingais an experienced professor, so I feel like over time he probably perfected his lectures so they can't get better than this. I enjoyedthem although at times I haven't come prepared to class so I had some difficulty understanding the topic, but that was my fault. Ididn't like the discussions, I felt like they were fast paced and not discussions at all but it could be the TA or just me. I had fun in thisclass but I do sometimes wish I came more prepared to certain lectures."
I enjoyed your enthusiasm for teaching. Lectures were always engaging and exciting. Thank you!
I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about economics and I loved professor Elzinga's teaching style.
I enjoyed learning in this class and found it very interesting
"I liked it but I often found it hard to focus during the lecture and wished the slides were more detailed because it was hard to keepup with his fast paced lecture."
the information is very well taught
It was fun!
Overall I thought that the course had a good structure and was generally interesting.
"It was a challenging course for me, and I felt like the lectures did not focus enough on breaking down the material. Sometimes I feltlike we were focusing on things that were slightly irrelevant to the course as a whole instead of really trying to make the materialdigestible for all students."
"As a visual learner, I would have appreciated having access to the slides. Other than that I loved this class."
"I would say that the course is wonderful and I'm glad that I took the course, I was worried at first but and although I have not done aswell on exams as I wished, I am still glad I took the exam and really learned Principles of Microecon."
Great class
I thoroughly enjoyed this class
it was fine but kind of hard
I really enjoyed the real life examples used during lectures.
"I know that Professor Elzinga's office hours seem to be very popular and crowded and with the size of the classroom and theamount of material he cannot answer questions, I know there is the TAs and such but sometimes the extra help seems out ofreach."
I had a great experience but it was definitely a difficult class. It teaches you a lot!
"Interesting and fun class with reasonable course load, please just make econ minutes a listed/unlisted you tube video"
"The course was very enjoyable. It spiked my interest in economics and commerce and I feel it prepared me well for courses I planto take in the future."
"It was very enjoyable. Professor Elzinga is a very comedic man along with an effective teacher. He makes it feel more like applicableand interesting knowledge instead of classic school material."
"I really enjoyed this course. No wonder Elzinga has been teaching for so long. His interesting lectures and deep dive into the theorybehind economics have solidified my interest in this topic. His passion and commitment to students shines through in his work. Iwill say the class is somewhat dependent on how well your TA teaches making it harder to obtain a good grade if your TA isn't thebest like mine was this semester."
"I loved it! I also really enjoy the subject, but the lectures were very engaging and the professor is clearly very knowledgable."
"The only time we can interact, and discus is in the discussion sessions. I would like more interactions in class."
I enjoyed Professor Elzinga's lecture because he made them interesting and applicable to the real world.
"Overall, I had a positive experience in the class. I liked the PEG sheet at the beginning, so we could see what we would be talkingabout that day in class."
This course is fun and intuitive.
I really enjoyed the course and it added significantly to my current knowledge on the topic.
I think the lectures were very helpful but they could have covered more material in the textbook that was harder to understand.
it was a good class but I think the professor and or TA needed to better prepare us for the exams
"I wish there will be more accurate practice exams and more discussion, maybe some group activities."
"The lectures were not super useful because my professor rambled on about irrelevant examples, while not explaining the actualmaterial that we were supposed to be learning. Also, we never did practice questions in lecture that would inevitably be on theexam, leaving it up to our TAs, who sometimes did not give us examples."
"Please stick to the content. The more off topic class got, the more sleepy I got."
"Overall very good experience with life–changing subject matter, but the exams are very subjectively graded and more difficult thannecessary."
This was a really enjoyable course that expanded my knowledge of microeconomics.
"It was great to learn from such an established and proficient professor but I feel the lecture classes are kind of boring. It is hard tokeep my attention for too long. However, that is a common downside to any big lectures so I don't blame him at all. I just wishedthere was NO CLICKER QUESTIONS . I could not get too many points because it never worked for me with the bad wifi connection!"
i really enjoyed it
"Elzinga is a great guy, but he does get quite off topic sometimes!"
it was hard lol but interesting experience
"I really did not enjoy the structure of this course. I was 100% new to economics and found that the large lecture size andinconsistent TAs did not allow me to get the support that I needed throughout the semester. I don't know how to remedy that with aclass so large, but I've found that my TAs who are grad students (in other courses) were way better than an undergrad student"
"I think that less abstract slides in the lectures, such as more definitions and graphic examples, would help students retain theinformation better. Some of the long form examples that the professor gives are interesting and thought–provoking, but arechallenging to translate into helpful notes to review the concepts later."
"Professor Elzinga was the reason I kept going, despite the class not being the most interesting to me."
"Great class, Elzinga is clearly so so knowledgeable in this field. For weaker students like me, I had hoped this course covered thebasics of concepts a bit more rather than assuming we understood it from the texbook. I am more than likely going to get a poorgrade in this class, I had a poor experience with my TA, but professor Elzinga is great."
"It was harder than I anticipated. I felt like the first exam was much easier than the second conceptually, which is why I think it wouldhave been more beneficial to go over the first few topics a little quicker to go over the more complicated topics into more depth."
"taking it as a forced requirement for my masters program. Although I didn't have the highest expectations, this class far surpassedthem. Elzinga is engaging and informative, I thought the content was relevant and easy to follow with a little effort."
"I enjoyed my time in the course and hope it helps other students as it has helped me understand the world and society as we knowit."
"I enjoyed my experience in this class. Having no prior experience to ECON, it was a great introduction and has made me moreinterested in the field."
I gained a deeper understanding of econ principles.
It was a very difficult course to navigate studying in.
Professor Elzinga rocks!!!
"Elzinga should have a pay cut. The textbook was more straightforward than this man. Also iclicker is expensive pollEv is free andactually connects to the wifi."
"I really liked Econ 2010 and would definitely it to anyone interested in econ or just finance and business in general. I really liked theformat of the class and I do not have any major complaints."
"As I biology major, I took this class simply out of interest for the topic. Upon completing this course I can say that I am happy with mydecision. I've enjoyed being able to look at real–world institutions and apply my basic econ knowledge to them."
"I am so glad there were so many resources to assist in this class such as study sessions, textbook questions, and past tests. Ifthis wasn't included the class would be almost impossible just based on the lectures themselves, which didn't line up with coursematerial."
"I had an overall okay experience, it is an interesting class but it is very challenging."
Good class classic professor.
It was nice. I felt like I learned a lot.
"I enjoyed my experience in this class very much but the only thing I would rather have is more work to do during class to get a betterunderstanding of the material."
"Professor Elzinga's lectures were refreshing. He did not regurgitate textbook definitions or review supply & demand graphs for anhour, but rather, he presented the information in a real–world and memorable fashion. He is pleasant and his office hours were aneven greater joy, because he is a great conversationalist and incredibly wise. He has probably been one of my favorite professorsthus far. I enjoyed every minute of this class, even though I am not the best at economics."
"My experience in this course has led me to realize a strong dislike for economics. The readings were tedious and extensive,making it challenging to maintain interest. The lectures, while informative, were difficult to follow entirely without laser focus. Thediscussion sections proved helpful for review, but the limited opportunities for grading created added pressure. Messing up onemidterm means relying solely on the final for redemption. To alleviate this issue, I suggest incorporating more activities with higherpoint values or additional midterms. Additionally, short answer questions are a challenging format. While I understand thatProfessor Elzinga may have a longstanding teaching approach, reconsidering the evaluation structure could enhance the learningexperience for students."
"I absolutely loved this course. It provided a very good basis of understanding of economics as a whole and helped increase myfiscal knowledge significantly. Many thanks to Professor Elzinga – he is just as great as everyone says he is!!"
"I really enjoyed this course, and I feel that I have learned significantly more about econ than I previously knew!"
it was meh
"I had a great experience in this course! The lectures were informative but also engaging, and the conceptual and real–worldapplication of course topics were extremely beneficial."
sure
This course has really made me start to think like an economist and I am now very excited to continue studying economics.
"It was a very good experience. The layout of the course is nice and easy to follow. There is a reasonable amount of work and if youput in the work it is definitely doable to get a good grade. Great intro course with a great instructor!"
I loved my experience and I think Professor Elzinga is fantastic
"I really enjoyed this course and what we learned. I loved the lectures and felt like they were really engaging. The one thing is is that Iwish our grade was not strictly depenent on tests we take because there are other ways to demonstrate learning and it would havebeen helpful."
Professor Elzinga is a really knowledgeable and kind professor who really cares about his students
"The content in lectures could be covered more concisely and understandably in 15 minutes, but somehow the information always ismade more complicated than necessary. It's very hard to take notes on lectures too. Also, it's annoying that the econ minutesdisappear and you have to pay for an iClicker subscription."
the exams are much harder than the class itself
He is a great professor
I enjoyed this class!
"This course taught me a lot about economics! Lectures were interesting and helped with comprehension of the readings in thetextbook."
I really enjoyed this course. I have never taken microeconomics before and I feel like I really understand the material.
The lectures were very interesting and professor Elizinga did a great job
I enjoyed the class. Mr. Elzinga is still a fantastic lecturer and an expert in the field of economics.
"This was the only class I had this semester that I actively looked forward to going to every Tuesday and Thursday! I'm in the uniqueposition of having taken AP Microeconomics before, but the credits didn't transfer. Because of this, I had a decent foundation inmany of the core concepts and was able to really listen to and process the content on a deeper level in lecture. This was a greatclass, with a great professor, and I hope to take another class with Mr. Elzinga in the future."
"I would like them to know that econ 2010 is a great introductory course that is useful to all students. The course is challenging butthe resources provided helped me stay on pace with the class."
I thought the lectures were a bit unclear sometimes in terms of what information was vital to know
I enjoyed the lectures. The professor always made connections to the material that were engaging and funny.
It is a pure lecture with the exception of the iClicker questions
"Elzinga is well known for a reason, this class was really cool to get to experience!"
"The professor made a large lecture feel more interesting than monotonous, which is a tricky feat. The professor was personableand knowledge, and they did a great job of providing analogies and examples that were relatable and easy to understand."
"I had a wonderful experience in the course, and would recommend it to other incoming students at UVA. I would have wished thatsometimes lectures could have been more engaging, but I understand with a room of 400+ students it's hard to tailor to each andevery preference."
I learned alot and I can see myself using it in my future.
This course made me enjoy econ much more than before and consider a major related to it!
"I had a good experience in the course overall, but I felt blind going into exams and it would have been nice to have some sort ofstudy guide or a clearer definition of what was going to be on the exam."
"I really enjoyed this class, and thought it was very well done."
I found the lecturer covered some very interesting topics but had a tendency to skip around the main point.
I loved this class and it was a great introduction to ECON!
"The course has been very informative in revising and growing my knowledge on Economics. I've enjoyed every lecture I've been toand it deeply saddens me that theres only one more lecture left. The professor's lectures are always a joy to attend. His lecture wasthe first lecture I had at the university and the course in general has been a highlight for my first semester."
"I had a great time being introduced to economics in this course. I find the content really interesting and I apply many of theprinciples I've learned to my everyday life."
"I think ECON 201 really expanded my interest in the field of economics and has made the field a potential major I am thinking oflooking at. The way Elzinga lectured has helped me develop a good intuitive feel for thinking like an economist."
It was good.
I felt the course was somewhat inconsistent because we would learn about unrelated topics.
I didn't like how econ minutes were only up for a week
I liked this course. It was difficult but I am glad I took it.
I think the time period is a good time for a lecture to last. Sometimes it feels a little long but you learn a lot in this time period.
"This course pushed me, but my knowledge of the concepts increased greatly, which means the TA was successful in her job."
good lecturer
"It's an amazing course, every lesson spiked my interest. I just wished that it was easier to understand,."
"Professor Elzinga has still got it. I loved his lectures and appreciated the amount of time Elzinga spent on the class. Elzinga mademe feel comfortable in a class of almost 500."
I thought that the discussion piece was difficult to understand because no one really talked
The class is very heavy. If you miss one lecture you get lost. It would be helpful if lectures were recorded.
"Enjoyed the class, but really wished there could've been some recorded lectures."
"I enjoyed this class and would not change anything about it, but the grading scale was extremely test heavy."
"I couldn't imagine learning this course from anyone other than Professor Elzinga. He is such a kind and genuine person and it isobvious through the passion he has for teaching and Econ."
I am happy with the way that the course played out. The exams were fair and the discussion were a good addition.
"Lectures were interesting. The only change I would make is making the slides have more words correlating to what the professor issaying."
"A lot of vagueness in lecture, exams ridiculously hard"
"I liked this course a lot. I wish we had a portion of a problem set due each week instead of 4 large problem sets. I wish the econminutes were always available."
"It was an interesting class that intertwined both logic and theory for me. It was an enjoyable time, besides stressing over my grade."
"It's easy to see how Professor Elzinga is an institution at UVA; anyone who takes this class would want to become an Econ Major. Atfirst, I had no interest in studying Economics and I took this class because it is a Batten prerequisite. Now, I have dropped byintention of applying to Batten entirely so I can focus on Economics."
I thought the lectures were fun and interesting
It was informative
It was good
"I really enjoyed the class, the lectures are engaging and it is easy to understand the different topics covered in class."
I feel sometimes the lecture deviates too much from the syllabus and it becomes difficult to follow up the lecture content.
"I really liked your class. You made me really interested in microeconomics from the way you taught it. I liked all your examples andstories from your experience. Before coming to UVA, I worked at the pool and I told a man at the pool that I was going to UVA. Hementioned that he had been a student at UVA about 40ish years ago and that the best teacher he ever had was Elzinga and then Itold him that I was having you this semester. He said he caused a lot of trouble in your class but you were the best teacher and hewas not wrong!"
I wish the textbook and the lectures aligned more with each other.
"Overall, I would say that I learned a lot but that I think there should be more chances to improve your grade rather than just threetests. I know we have assignments in our discussion that contribute to our overall grade, but they don't alter your grade in thescheme of things."
"It was kind of difficult to take notes during the lecture. The slides did not have words on them and Professor Elzinga talked very fastso I wasn't sure what was important or not"
"Overall, the information presented was interesting, but did not always directly connect to exams or the textbook. It was sometimesunclear what was content and what was side information."
"I really enjoyed this course and felt as if the professor, despite being responsible for so many students, was always there to help.There was never a time that I felt as if I could not go to or email the professor for help."
I think it's a good course.
It was a great experience for me. I liked the discussions and lectures.
"I had a great experience with this course. Econ is very challenging for me, but it introduced me to a whole new way of thinking. Mydad also took this class 30 years ago with Elzinga, so it was super cool that I was able to share this experience with him."
No notes! I thought it was well organized
I feel as though in the class we could incorporate more witting and example questions
"I understand the way it is because of the sheer large number of students, so overall it was good. I enjoyed it, my professor wasawesome."
"I enjoyed learning about economics, but I had difficulty comprehending a large amount of the information. This class was difficult forme as I had never studied information relating to economics."
I thoroughly enjoyed the course and would recommend it to anyone.
"Econ was tough for me but I wouldn't have wanted another professor besides Elzinga because he was a sort of story–teller type oflecturer which was great for me because it simplified some concepts I was having trouble with."
"I enjoyed the course but there were times where I lost interest or got confused. The happens though and the discussions reallyhelped me understand what I was confused on"
I think there should be more practice work.
"I really enjoyed taking this course, even though I had trouble with certain concepts at times."
"Elzinga really does have a deep understanding of these topics and I enjoy the way he teaches you to think like an economist ratherthan just learn economics. You can really tell he has a passion for teaching."
"I valued the lectures much more than the discussion sessions, and the readings were long but did somewhat help myunderstanding."
"I wish there was more practice outside of class, and participation points, the exam grade is very difficult and hard despite knowingthe material."
"Overall, I did learn a lot from this course."
I had a very good time during this course
"It was a very enjoyable course and made me more passionate about the world of economics. I went into it a little skeptical, andwent out smarter and more eager to learn."
"I loved this course as it helped me decide whether or not I wanted to major in econ or business. I found it very interesting, however Ipersonally don't like thinking about theory so I think I will set on the path of a comm major. However, I still really enjoyed the lectureand found the material engaging."
I found this course very engaging as a first time econ student.
"I really enjoined this course and ho interactive it was. My only complainant is learning the same tuff but i little different three times. Ifelt i learned it with elzinga, reading colander was phrased and a little different, and then my TA would talk really fast and be a littledifferent. Learning it three times sometimes overwhelmed me but that is my only complaint."
"I think to do well in this course, you must attend lectures and read the textbook. It seems that many people assume you can be finedoing one or the other, and I wish there had been more transparency at the beginning of the course about what to do to be preparedfor the tests."
I thought Professor Elzinga was very knowledgeable.
legendary.
"The discussion section was by far the best way to learn material from both the textbook and the lectures, and I would not change athing about the format of the discussions."
"I really enjoyed Econ 201, and I feel that it has provided me with a very strong foundation that I can use going forward in the subject."
"I feel like some of the exams covered certain concepts that were not talked about in lecture, and if they were it was for 10 seconds,which I feel is not vary fair."
This course was good but Elzinga's teaching style isn't the best and seems dated.
"Professor Elzinga is the man, teaches a course that requires critical thinking and application of concepts to do well on exams, notjust memorization which is awesome. Loved every minute of this class even when the readings were long."
I had a great year and loved the course!
The lectures were boring in my opinion and it was hard to pay attention for the full hour.
My experience in this course was really good! I realized that I liked economics a lot more than I thought I did.
It's very interesting and I enjoyed it sometimes.
"Overall, taking this course was an incredibly positive experience!"
I think having more clicker questions in class that align similarly with the structure of those on exams would be very beneficial.
You are a great teacher!
"I would like them to know that it is a very well structured class, and despite the size of the class I still feel like I learned so mucheven besides just the textbook."
"This course has been very challenging for me as I did not have any background in economics before taking this class. I believe thatdiscussion sections and problem sets helped me understand the material but I wish that we would have gotten some morepractice problems that were more similar to the exam. I also think that there were a lot of resources available to help us study andbe more successful but I was just not aware of these resources until after the first 2 exams."
"I found the discussion sections pretty unhelpful. I would have done just as well without the discussion section and would have anextra 50 minutes of time each week."
I enjoyed learning about micro economics
"My experience was very good for a class this large. I feel like the textbook should be update though. It gets annoying when you studythings in the textbook that the head TA calls irrelevant at review sessions. Also, posting an exam topic sheet would be very helpfulfrom discerning irrelevant information."
"My experience in this course has been a rocky one just because I am not used to big classes like this coming from a small school. Ididn't think it was hard to understand, but for some reason, I felt myself get distracted more easily and was hard to tune in and justfocus. So, I think that is where the discussion section helped a bit but I think the real material was during lecture and because Inever took economics in high school, it took me longer to grasp the concepts."
"It was a great course and I had a lot of fun, but my TA did not teach my discussion well causing me to do poorly on some of thetests."
"Overall very good class, but main lecture could have more notes on screen as we move slowly at some times and very quickly atothers."
"I really enjoyed the course and my overall experience in the class was great. I learned a lot and definitely became much moreinterested in the study of economics after taking this. I also discovered that I'm pretty good at it!"
I didn't know anything about economics coming into the course and left with a much better understanding.
good
"I enjoyed Professor Elzinga's lectures but found that I had a difficult time in the course. It was definitely hard for me to adjust to thelarge lectures coming from a high school where my classes never exceeded 14 students, and my school had a 5:1 student–to–teacher ratio to provide students with one–one aid. I wish we had more practice problems throughout the course as I oftentimesunderstood the concepts that were taught, but didn't know how to apply them to the questions on the exams."
"There are days were the lectures are straightforward and easy to understand and follow, and there are days where things that wouldbe discussed in the lectures are jumbled up and leave me really confused."
The curriculum was set up well and progressed well. Some of the topics felt hard to fully comprehend simply from the lectures.
"I think the course is really well managed and, even though it is a 450 person class, I did not feel like I did not have enoughresources to properly study and learn the course content, and felt confident in my access to faculty to express my doubts andissues."
Best lecturer
"Overall, very pleasant. I had no interest in ECON before this course as it was purely a requirement for my major. However, thatquickly changed I gained a deep interest in the subject and came to enjoy the content and course very much."
"The lectures were intresting, and I enjoyed the occasional humor thrown in to each lecture."
"Prof. Elzinga was excellent. His dedication to economics is apparent, which makes for a more enjoyable lecture. I hope you are ableto teach for another 50 years!"
LOVE
"This course did expose me to connections between economics and the real world that I would not have realized or recognized onmy own. However, this course did make me doubt my interest in economics because of the unique explanations Professor Elzingagave. While I do believe that his explanations are well thought out, detailed, and clear, I sometimes feel that it complicated myunderstanding of the economic concept/topic than it did simplify it."
This class was both challenging and informative and has made me consider a future major in economics.
"Office Hours were also very helpful for me. I often found myself reviewing my essays and practice tests in office hours with my TA.The review sessions before an exam with head TA, Justin, were also extremely beneficial to me."
"Wifi and internet connection in the lecture hall was difficult to deal with since parts of the class are required to be online – addedextra stress"
"Loved this course, the discussions, and the lectures. Elzinga is an amazing lecturer, and really dives deep into behaviors andsociety and what economics means to people, which made it a lot more interesting than just staring at graphs ."
I loved this course! Taking this course made me extremely interested in a subject I would not have expected to enjoy so much.
"I would like them to know that this course is extremely useful and important for students to take. The 3–examnination grading formatcan definitely be quite stress–provoking, but overall a great course."
The lectures were hard to stay engaged but econ minutes were fun and interesting
My experience in this course was very positive.
I really enjoyed taking Econ 201 and believe that this course made me want to become an economics major.
"I really liked this course but I think the different between TA teacher and grading is unfair. At times I struggled to understand whatwas going on in my discussion class while other students with different TA's had easier times and had better review sessions."
The lectures were always great. I love the bits of humor in every lecture and just how well the material was always explained.
"I understand various economic concepts in this course, but I think the lectures could be better."
I enjoyed learning economics and it gave me a fundamental understanding of econ.
Very helpful and great for basis learning
I liked his lecture style and ability to keep me engaged
I found the instructor to be fantastic. I am a big fan of Professor Elzinga. I have found the exams to be difficult.
Happy to have gotten a class with Elzinga before he retires.
"I think for a person that has never taken an Econ class it was a good overview, however as I had never taken Econ it was a steeplearning curve"
"I think this course was a good introduction to microeconomics and really emphasized looking at economics from a multitude ofperspectives. The beginning half of the course was easier to understand, while the supply–side material between exams 1 and 2was more difficult because of all the graphs."
This class was very applicable and interesting
"I enjoyed it a lot, and I love Elzinga's teaching style. He also shows immense respect to the TA's and students, he is very honorableman."
"This class is amazing, and Mr. Elzinga is very good at his job (as I'm sure everyone already knows). It was a joy to be in his class,and I hope as many people as possible get to take this class with him."
"If the lectures could be recorded that would be very helpful, but overall I enjoyed my experience"
I really enjoyed the class and am looking forward to continue studying the subject of economics
"I loved the experience of taking Professor Elzinga's Economics course. It is abundantly clear he cares about both his students andthe subject matter."
Elzinga is a very good professor and he did a great job teaching this course.
"fantastic course, very interesting"
"I would like the instructor and university administration to know that I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It was one of my favorites thissemester even though its completely unrelated to my field of study."
"I am super interested in Econ and the whole money world. I feel economist have a different look on life and I am curious to figureout exactly how an economist thinks, especially when it comes to that persons money and financials."
"I absolutely loved this course! Although I do wish that the slides had a bit more relevant information displayed on them (to help outthe students who did not manage to write down everything Professor Elzinga said), I was truly engaged and interested in everysingle lecture. There's a reason this course is renowned as a must–take at UVA!"
This was a great foundational course that many people should take to have a better understanding of economics in general.
"This course has been straightforward and easy to navigate. While the material can be difficult and confusing, it was covered wellwith the combination of the lecture and discussion section."
"I am grateful to have taken this class! Even though I am not following an Econ path, I feel like I have a deeper understanding of theworld from the economic perspective."
I would like them to know that Elzinga is a very charming type of guy! I really enjoyed hearing him speak throughout the semester.
I found the class informational and approachable for someone with no prior academic economic experience.
I enjoyed Elzinga's lectures and believe that they help connect everyday topics to microeconomics.
pretty good overall
I really believe recording the lectures would help students to go back and understand the lecture content better.
It was challenging but engaging and valuable in the real life.
I had a great experience and have learned a great deal!
I wish we had study guides for the exam and I wish there were class notes for each class
I am happy taking this class.
I loved the course!
I feel prepared
"I think this was a good course although it got off topic at times and it was kind of hard to focus in on. However, professor Elzingawas a good professor and it was a good class."
Discussion really helps solidify the concepts introduced in lecture.
exceptional in educating students on the topic of microeconomics.
Good teacher. Not a fan of the exams.
"This was a great course! It was engaging, focused on material that is interesting and applicable to the real world, and did notinvolve any busy work. This was my favorite class this semester."
Professor Elzinga is a good instructor.
"Straightforward, interesting, helpful, reasonable, etc. Doesn't need any changing."
I had a pretty good experience.
"I really enjoyed this course and appreciated that the content that we went over in the lecture was applicable to real life and not just asummary of the textbook."
"Was very enjoyable lectures, but when you don't understand something and it is said ""You will be an expert by this by the end of thisweek,"" it makes you feel as if you are behind."
It was a well run course that I think was fairly judged and covers the material.
Elzinga's lectures were a true treasure to go to.
My experience with this course was very positive. The course greatly increased my interest in economics.
it was good
I really enjoyed the course and Professor Elzinga's style of teaching!
All went well
fantastic
"It was tough, especially not knowing any econ previously."
"i didn't like this course, because it was incredibly challenging"
"I do not think this is a particularly difficult course if students put in enough time and effor to study the text in addition to attendlectures. There is not too much to worry about in terms of classwork either. Overall quite a pleasant experience for me."
"I want Mr Elzinga to know that he is a very knowledgeable professor and he really made every concept in the lecture understandableand in–depth. I developed my passion more for Econ and I am more certain now with the business path that I am choosing"
"I loved this course, Prof. Elzinga is beyond excellent and makes simple economic concepts captivating."
Professor Elzinga does a great job keeping the lecture engaging even though it has almost 400 students
"This course was highly informational but challenging since it forced me to learn and take tests in a unfamiliar way. It was definitelywell designed for how many students are in the course"
I think your experience can weigh heavily on your discussion and TA experience.
I like this course! Not the most out of the box/creative class I have ever intended but it does what it needs to do.
"I greatly enjoyed the course and hope to take more of professor Elzinga's courses in the future. My main preference would be to beable to lecture for longer periods of time, not only for 50 minutes."
"Sometimes I feel like the examples given in lecture can be too abstract or don't closely adhere with what we are learning inColander"
I loved it
"Lectures were very engaging if you paid attention, and Elzinga laid out his ideas in a way that was mostly very easy to attain. Hestructured them in a way that made sense to students. Elzinga is so charming and adorable and I loved coming to his class. I feellike it would be easy to make an intro economics classes boring, but I loved going through each lecture. I am going to miss thisclass so much! Elzinga reflected his love of econ onto us students, and when I would be studying I didn't completely dread itbecause I know it is relevant information. Studying for the second midterm I even looked into switching my major to Econ, but thenrealized you have to take Calc 2 and changed my mind. Loved this course, thank you Elzinga for your dedication and service to yourstudents!!"
The instructor is great and his teachings were amazing
"Excellent and informative course. Despite this being my largest class this semester, Professor Elzinga made it feel like one of mysmallest. He was also extremely responsive and worked with me to ensure I would be successful in the course when I was in thehospital for a couple weeks early in the semester. Interesting field I'd like to explore further and a great professor."
I enjoyed my experience in this course and it furthered my interest on economic topics.
I enjoyed the lectures and I thought your expectations of us were very consistent which I appreciate.
"I struggled in real time lectures because there were so many people but I enjoyed how Proffesor Elzinga went into tangents of smallthings that helped the understanding of small concepts better."
It was a really informative class.
"I enjoyed this course however exam content is very difficult with little to no prep materials given. I would hope in the future the reviewsessions were more extensive and structured"
"I think that some of the lectures were a little hard to follow, but overall, the course is a good introduction to microeconomics."
"This was my first large lecture class, and I'm glad I was able to take it and increase my knowledge in the basics of economics."
"I thought Professor Elzinga taught the course very well. I didn't know what to expect coming into the class. I am not very interested inEcon, but I found this class to be interesting! I liked how the lectures and exams are fairly straight forward."
"It's inspiring to have a professor be so passionate about both teaching and the material they teach, and Elzinga definitely checksboth of these boxes."
"Professor Elzinga is amazing. Rumors were definitely true, as this class is difficult but fascinating."
Fantastic really enjoyed this
"i really liked the format of the lectures and because Im a visual learner, the slides were helpful to look at"
"I'd appreciate more opportunities to show my understanding, perhaps homework assignments or universal class problem sets."
"Prof. Elzinga was an engaging teacher and it is evident that he is passionate about what he teaches. I really enjoyed ECON 2010and it has made me interested in studying more economics."
I thought for the amount of material covered it the course Elzinga did a good job at covering it in a thorough way.
I like mr. Elzinga
The clicker questions were helpful when they were able to work
The lectures were a great balance between entertaining and informational.
I think having more practice would help to learn the content better.
"it provides a great first exposure to economics, however the tests are very challenging and your grade greatly depends on priorknowledge of the subject and who your TA is"
"I really enjoyed taking ECON 2010! I think the course is set up well and gives students the opportunity to learn a lot and succeed inclass."
I had no prior experience with the subject
"I am not an economics major or an intended pre–commerce student. However, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience in this courseboth in lecture and discussion. I learned so much about economics but also life. I had no idea that so much of my life has to do witheconomics, and honestly, that fascinates me. I have only had experience with economics on a macro level, so I enjoyed learningabout it on a micro scale, too. Finally, I hope to become a pediatrician and start my own practice, so I am very grateful for all of theinformation that I have learned about opportunity cost, maximizing utility, incentives, income, externalities, and more. Finally, I reallyappreciated how engaged and excited Professor Elzinga seemed about teaching us and the topics he was teaching, for I feel as ifthat has not always been the case with some of my other professors at UVA."
"I enjoyed ECON 2010 a lot. However, I do wish there were more opportunities for test correction, especially because this is the firstcollege class that a lot of students took."
"It is a great introductory course, however, being someone who has never taken any Economics classes before, this course can bechallenging as an introductory level course."
love u elzinga <3
It was quite enjoyable but the slides should have more information that is relevant to what will be on the tests.
"This could be a one time lecture a week for 45 minutes if he talked about what actually mattered and what would be on the exam.Most of the time you have to guess."
"I really enjoyed the lectures and thought that they were very varied and captivating. Overall, this course has pique my interest ofeconomics and I will be taking macroeconomics in the spring!"
"Elzinga is a phenomenal teacher, and I only wish I had spent more time in this class."
The instructor is kind but changes to his lecture style should be made
"I am not the most interested in Economics, but Prof. Elzinga is a very experienced, knowledgeable professor. He has worked formany years in Economics and his wiseness shows in his lectures. Although the subject matter can be boring at times, he does hisbest to make it interesting."
"I thought Elzinga was a very good lecturer in terms of getting information across even if they aren't always the most entertaining andcan sometime lose my attention."
"The lack of open rubric to the students when negotiating your grade on an exam was discomforting. Also the grading was harshand the lack of multiple choice questions discouraged me."
"helpful and knowledgeable. As a first year, having Professor Elzinga is a great intro to not only economics but also college lectures."
You are the best lecturer I have had in my life so far. It was fun.
"I definitely struggled with this course. I'm not used to this type of learning, but overall the course was interesting."
"I really enjoyed it , and felt like I learned very applicable information to life."
"good lectures, hard to take notes sometimes"
it was well organized
"Economics lecture as my first class on Tuesdays and Thursdays has been something I looked forward to since the previous night,because the chemistry building is close to Rice Hall, which is where my favorite bagel place is located."
I really enjoyed the course and his lectures; I have no issues with this class.
"Great class, great professor."
I enjoyed this course a lot and it definitely sparked a greater interest in econ but that being said I learned mostly from the textbook.
"I would say overall my experience was pretty good, the only thing I really have to say is that the slides that he puts up can be a bitconfusing to fully grasp the information if you happen to miss a lecture."
N/a
It was a good experience
"Mr. Elzinga is one of the best professor's at this university, because he provides the most interesting and interactive lectures I'veever been to"
I loved getting to come to Econ lectures and learn about the principles of microeconomics thanks to Mr. Elzinga
It was a very fun and engaging course
amazing teacher
"I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and learned a lot about economics and markets and how they work."
There are days when lectures are easier to understand and when they are not.
This course was intriguing.
"This was one of my favorite classes because of Professor Elzinga. I learned a ton about Micro. Unlike many classes, it did not likefeel like a burden to attend his lectures. Ending the lectures 10 minutes before the official end also enhanced my focus."
i loved the class
Elzinga is great at making lectures engaging.
"The professor is my favorite I've had so far: Clear, funny, caring, and enthusiastic about the topic without overwhelming students"
Keep it up!
Excellent class. Everyone should take it.
I feel like I could have learned a lot more; a lot of the lecture time felt like it was wasted
I enjoyed my experience in this class and learned a lot as well.
"Inevitably, the students in front of you will always mess around on their computers, causing a distraction"
I really appreciate the flexibility of his grading and his exuberant personality.
"I wish there were more homework assignments or materials throughout the semester to reinforce understanding of specificconcepts as we go, as opposed to only having 3 HW assignments and practice exams."
The material was taught pretty fast.
"I think Professor Elzinga does a great job of making the lectures engaging and easy to grasp. I only wish that there were alsorecorded lectures that could be viewed for reiteration."
This course is great
"I would like them to know that this course has increased my intrigue in the field of economics, it has led me to mastering severalmicroeconomics concepts, and it has increased my good standing with my girlfriend since I am now better at rationally maximizingher utility."
"I have had a good experience in this course, but I wish there were more opportunities for homework/projects that could help furtherour learning in the subject area."
"I really enjoyed this class, but I wish it was a little closer to the textbook so that I wasn't teaching some concepts to myself."
"This was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. Professor Elzinga is very effective in his lecture strategy, which combines wellwith his easy–going personality."
"Lectures covered interesting content but were too often not relevant for exams. If you want to give that kind of lecture, stop givingtextbook exams. It felt like I mostly taught this course to myself. Textbooks are supplements, not teachers."
The was one of my favorite courses and I enjoyed coming to lecture.
This was my favorite class. I enjoyed learning from Professor Elzinga
"I did not find the lectures useful and found myself learning most of the material from the textbook, online resources, and from mydiscussion section."
"Overall, pretty good class."
I wish that profesor Elzinga taught more classes. His style and love for the subject created a real joy and interests in the subject.
"I know it's probably very difficult given the size of the class but I think a project or two in between the midterms would serve as evenbetter reinforcement and application of the material we learned."
Lectures were as entertaining as possible. I liked the shortened classes.
I liked the courses but it is difficult. It is extremely fast–paced but if you put in the work you get the results.
"I was frustrated with the use of iClicker because sometimes the connection was poor and even though I knew the answers to thequestions, I couldn't submit and answer. It was stressful because I worried my grade would suffer not because of my knowledgebut because of the Wifi."
"I had a very enjoyable time in this class, it was very engaging and beneficial to my learning."
Overall good!
I wish we were provided with more resources and practice activities.
It was nice and an honor to be taught by Professor Elzinga.
"Having no class recording for this 400+ students class is weeeeird. Although the TAs have lecture note, they don't want to share it.They also don't ask to offer scribe's notes even when the students are sick. Weird. The only way to make up for missed class (Evenwhen you are sick!) is to ask for a note from your friend."
"I feel like there were some lectures that I was sitting in and it felt like I was not benefitting much from them. I went to every lecture,and at least half of them I found did not give me any more information than the textbook. The better lectures, such as the elasticitieslectures and the getting rich the econ way lectures, were helpful but many felt unhelpful, or at least did not feel very beneficial."
"This was my first time in a huge lecture style class, but overall it was a good experience."
"The lectures were kinda boring, but I've never taken an econ class before, and this made me enjoy econ, so I'm glad I took it"
"Elzinga is a beast, Justin Garrison is alright, but he sometimes does not know how to grade free–response tests which is one ofmy major problems with this class since it often seemed very subjective and varied between the TA you had."
"I wish the lecture slides had more information and were posted to canvas before class. Also, it would help to have lecturesrecorded so that we could re–watch them"
"As a first semester college student, it was hard in the beginning to navigate how to best prepare for this class. Reading a textbookand being expected to apply what I read to a assessment question was challenging, but it also helped me prepare for the rest of mycollege experience. I enjoyed learning a whole new topic and how professor Elzinga structured his lectures."
"I came into this class very open–minded without any previous knowledge of economics. I thought I understood the lectures, alwaystaking notes on my computer, but the first exam really humbled me. For the second exam, I studied a week in advance, went to officehours, and talked to other people about the matter. I did so much better on the second exam and I was really proud of myself. Mygrowth in this class has sparked an interest in econ for me. This class challenges you mentally (tough questions) and physically(long lectures)."
I enjoyed the class
Elzinga is a good lecturer.
"I really enjoyed Microeconomics with Professor Elzinga. He discusses economics in a very thorough, straight–forward way. I like thestyle of his lectures as well. I came into the class with no prior knowledge of economics, so this was a great introductory levelcourse!"
"I enjoyed this course far more than I thought I was going to. Economics does not make a ton of sense to me, nor does it intrigueme, but I felt that I was readily prepared with the materials to be successful in this course."
"Elzinga is appropriately famous, a very good lecturer. He's still got it."
I enjoyed the class greatly.
It was awesome 10/10
for example).
I enjoyed it.
"It was an interesting class and I really enjoyed Professor Elzinga's lectures. They were very engaging and inspired interest in thisfield."
The course and exams are fair and gave me an excellent introduction to microeconomics.
I had a hard time learning from the lectures and sometimes felt that they made the concrete economic concepts more confusing.
I liked the class
This has been my favorite course thus far at UVA– I firmly believe everyone should be required to take it.
"For a class the size and volume of this one, I felt like I had a great experience and was able to get help when I needed it."
This course was very beneficial and I hope to take more courses in this subject matter in the future.
It was a great course which encouraged me to pursue more economics classes in the future.
It was nice
I liked this course!
I have had a wonderful experience in this course so far.
"I had a great time, and it has really increased my interest in a possible career in Economics."
"This course is definitely interesting but it would be more conducive to learning if lectures were spent diving into specific examplequestions and materials rather than the vast concepts. I also think all the Econ minutes should be available at the same time ornotifications should be sent out when a new video is uploaded to ensure everyone has an equal chance to view them."
This was a great course and it changed my way of thinking which was a pleasant surprise.
"I would like them to know that I had a fabulous time learning economics from this course, and I have developed an interest in thisfield. I would like to continue taking Economics courses and understand content because of this course."
My experience was overall very good. No complaints.
"I came into this class with a mild interest in economics. I was more challenged in this class than I thought I would be, so I had toreally reevaluate my study time and habits. At the end of the course, my interest in economics has grown significantly. One thing Iwould like to mention, I have a strong math background so I was hoping thee would be more math, but I guess I should haveexpected what I got from an introductory principles course."
"I think that Micro is a crucial class to take at UVA for anyone. There are so many important elements that you can take away from itregardless of your major."
"This class was incredible. Never taking an economics class before I had no idea what to expect, but this class was so intriguingand thought–provoking that I am now heavily considering a major in Economics. Elzinga is an amazing professor and I love how heteaches economics as a way of thinking and approaching problems. Justin Garrison, the head TA, is such an amazing teacher. Hisdiscussion section tied this whole class together and was crucial to my learning and interest. I do, however, wish there was morepractice with economic problems as the class was very much based on absorbing information through lecture, discussion andreading."
I had a good experience with this course. I think the current textbook is very good as well.
It was interesting.
"Econ 201 sparked my curiosity for behavioral economics. I am a firm supporter of the ""econ way of thinking,"" and I appreciateProfessor Elzinga's drive to teach an economics course designed not for econ or pre–comm majors, but for every student. Ithoroughly enjoyed my time in lectures and even reading the textbook, although the book was a bit repetitive and lengthy. The examswere a useful learning experience. Overall, the benefits of taking Professor Elzinga's Econ 201 course are greater than the costs."
It was great! Time was spent in lecture learning material.
"I don’t have any complaints, I think everything went smoothly."
I enjoyed my experience with this course a lot
That it was a great intro course and was able to cover a lot of material
"I loved this course. There was a lot of reading associated with it which would usually be difficult for me but I do feel that the readingwas a crucial aspect to my learning in this course. I find Professor Elzinga to be extremely engaging and loved the course overall."
It was really cool–––I can see why Elzinga is a legend.
It was good.
Nearly impossible to learn and stay focused
"please go through slides slower, kind of hard to get all the information down before you changed the slide"
I really enjoyed how Professor Elzinga explained concepts and created real life examples for us to learn.
This course could be improved by having a lecture recording that people could request if missing class.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and looked forward to seeing a new tie each day!
"As someone who did not really have any background in Econ, I found this course absolutely fascinating. I really like how it was moretheory–based and connected themes and topics from different units together."
"Good course, but exams are trickier then I feel we were prepared for."
"The exams are graded subjectively. Depending on the Ta, your grade could change easily."
"I feel I have learned a lot, but all of the discussions were not really helpful for me."
"I really liked this class, it has encouraged me to major in econ!"
Thank you
"I enjoyed this course thoroughly. Elzinga is a great professor. However, in a large lecture section as this class was, I highlyrecommend the discussion section and office hours."
"Especially because I came into this course with no background on Economics, I am happy that I can say that I learned conceptsneeded in order to understand the economic world while enrolled in this class. This class was one where I can leave and know Ilearned not only the material, but how the material learned can be applied to the real world."
I really enjoyed the course and now want to potentially major in economics!
For someone not very interested in this subject matter Elzinga was fun to listen to and I liked his stories
Overall experience was good.
"I loved learning about econ! I wasn't able to take an econ class in high school, so I really appreciated this opportunity. The classpushed me out of my comfort zone and really challenged me, as I was not used to this subject. I found the textbook to be the mosthelpful element of this class, but I also enjoyed some of the lecture content as well."
"It was pretty hard for me. I felt like I prepared a lot for the tests and still didn't do that great. I feel like I know the material well I don'treally know how to take the tests in this class."
"I enjoyed this class and would recommend it to other students. I have a deeper understanding of microeconomics and have evenstarted applying it to my everyday life. Professor Elzinga was a very compelling lecturer and I enjoyed having the opportunity to take aclass with him."
"The amount of people in the classroom is a little bit overwhelming, however I do not think that can change."
I enjoyed it and learned a lot
"I enjoyed learning about the principles of microeconomics, and I prefer this course over the high school AP macroeconomicscourse that I took last school year."
I am very fortunate to have learned microeconomics from the great Professor Elzinga.
Juliette Sellgreen was a great TA and was very good at her job
"The instructor's lectures were well prepared, sometimes they were hard to follow along in. But, overall the course provides somechallenging theoretical topics and while the midterms are pretty hard in the application of the material. Yet, the head TA and theinstructor know and have prepared students that this is the case and will provide support within grading"
It was a good class to take overall and it has increased my understanding of microeconomics.
The lectures could be dry but I liked the videos and funny parts of the lecture
"I wish the lectures did not included so much fluff. I feel as if going through applicable examples with graphs would be more helpfulthan simply rambling. The slides were not helpful"
It was difficult
It was a good course
This class is very hard and you basically have to teach it to yourself.
Professor Elzinga is a legend
I think there was a lot more textbook reading than i expected but i valued the in class lectures a lot more for my understanding
"I really enjoyed the real life applications in class because it allowed me to think about econ in my daily activities. I now see the worldin a whole new light."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this course throughout the year. Though it is challenging to know where you stand throughout the semester, Ifound that my knowledge of economics grew exponentially throughout the course. I would like to give a special shoutout to my TAAnna Murray. Her slide decks helped me connect the lectures to Colander and she was great at explaining Econ concepts that werenot explained thoroughly in the lecture."
I had a good experience in this course.
Very interesting class!
more guided practice
"Overall, I had a great experience in this course. The lectures were very helpful, as was the textbook and the Econ minute videos.Even if I was confused about something, I could just get it clarified during my discussion class."
Lectures can get really monotone and hard to pay attention
"It was a hard but somewhat interesting course. The textbook was extremely helpful, but sometimes the information was hard tocomprehend."
This class was very enjoyable and peaked my interest in the topic
That is was a good one.
"I really like how you started class at 11:05, I always remembered class to be at 11, so i was never late to class. Paying attention inclass proved to be a little challenging because the lecture was always felt very long."
"The lectures are no help. Only thing that helps with the exams are discussion sections and office hours. Further, exams are notphrased well and expect things that are not asked for (e.g., one exam required an example in the response in order to get full credit,but the question on the exam did not ask for an example or hint at including an example). Points are lost on exams for things thatare not stated or clarified like when it asks to ""define terms"" when Elzinga only gives you credit if you write the equation."
"Taking ECON 201 with Professor Elzinga has inspired me to pursue a minor in economics, a goal that was not even on my radarprior to my first semester at UVA."
"Through this course, I was able to understand economic thinking and what economics is better."
"Professor Elzinga’s lectures are extremely engaging. I would say the opportunity cost of me attending lecture is very low, because Igain a great amount of indispensable human capital and utility by going to his lecture. He is able to connect economics to the worldaround us through his absolute masterclass of a lecture."
I loved this course and its structure.
I learned very well and feel the Professor and TA did a great job of teaching.
this course was hard but it made me appreciate econ! i loved it.
"My experience in the course has been different from my other courses. I truly thought i understood the course materials until i got tothe test and would get market off alot for partial credit"
I thoroughly enjoyed this course and feel that I learned a lot of new and useful information.
"I would have liked some more outside class resources for studying, I attended nearly every lecture and felt I lacked properresources to study outside of class"
It was great
I have enjoyed this course and it has given me a much deeper understanding of microeconomic theory.
"This course is hard! But... incredibly interesting. It is such an honor to learn from a UVA legend like Professor Elzinga. That beingsaid, this class only works super well for those who are ""good"" at Econ. One bad exam grade in this course can really make youfeel like you are failing and no matter how much work you may put it in, sometimes there will be concepts that just don't click."
