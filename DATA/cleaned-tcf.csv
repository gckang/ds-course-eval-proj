Fall 2023,7/25/24,"This class was a decent introduction to microeconomics. I personally did not really like Professor Elzinga's teaching style, as he uses a lot of analogies / stories and I felt like that didn't leave us a lot of time to go really in depth on the topics. The final is worth A LOT, so I would recommend diligently reading the textbook every week and reviewing the content thoroughly to do well.",0,0,3.00,3,2,4,2,6
Fall 2023,4/27/24,TAKE DOYLE TAKE DOYLE TAKE DOYLE. This guy is too old to be teaching and this is not a joke. The midterms are formatted in the most bizarre way even though they are simple he will have a question that has something you have never gone through worth a lot of points to tank your grade. The midterms aren't even the problem it's the final. How does one person sit down and make that with a straight face like honestly who does that? I studied for so long just to stare at the paper and have no clue what was going on. PICK YOUR TA WISELY. Chill curve tho-saved my life,1,0,1.00,1,1,1,5,13
Fall 2023,4/11/24,"If you're gonna take Econ201, do it with Elzinga. Knowledgeable, lovable guy who you'll learn a lot about econ from. Pray for a good TA, it really makes a difference. Tons of textbook readings which you just have to grind through. Lectures get boring but material isn't that difficult. Going to office hours & working with others really helps.",0,0,3.67,4,3,4,3,5
Fall 2023,4/11/24,"This is a class you most likely will have to take and cannot get out of. The concepts are simple enough. Elzinga just has a very monotone voice. The class is structured such that the midterms and the final are what really matters. The grade in this class is based on how many points you are able to earn over time via midterms, clicker questions, and discussion sections. You will be required to buy a subscription to iClicker. I would recommend going on Reddit to get a cheaper subscription and save yourself a few bucks. The class isn't necessarily difficult, but the final is designed to produce a normal curve, so beware. If you pay attention in lectures and in discussions, you will pass. Elzinga has many office hours and is a chatterbox when you go but he seems to genuinely care about his students. His lectures contain some rambling, but there is essential information in them that you don't want to miss.",0,0,3.00,3,3,3,3,4
Fall 2023,4/02/24,"The lectures are super boring but the micro content is fascinating. Try to keep up with the readings so that the lecture actually makes sense, as Elzinga mostly shows real-world applications and doesn't teach much micro specifically. Exams aren't too bad if you study and understand implications of many things; don't only study what moves on graphs; study the reasoning and rationale. I really liked this class because of the content but never really went to lecture. I had an awesome TA so was able to learn really well but many of my friends had bad ones and struggled. You can get a good grade if you have a good TA and read the book, it is essentially self-taught. The final exam was impossible though so don't rly on dutch knockout...",0,0,4.67,4,5,5,3,3
Fall 2023,12/08/23,"I have mixed feelings on this class. First of all, lectures are really boring and it can be hard to stay engaged. Taking lecture notes is very important - there are no recordings or anything like that. In-class participation grades are from iClicker, which are super easy to get as long as you have consistent attendance. Econ minutes are also super important, which are posted online but only stay up for like a week or so, so you really gotta stay on top of that. Discussion sections are a toss up, some of them are good and grade chill, while others are super tough. Watch out for the midterms, you really have to ensure you do well on them because you can't depend on the dutch knockout. Read the textbook, pray you get into a good discussion section. Wouldn't recommend taking this class if you don't need to, and if you have to, take it w/ the other professor #tCFF23",0,0,3.00,4,2,3,4,2
Fall 2022,1/13/23,"Elzinga is a great guy and clearly very knowledgeable and passionate about economics. That being said, he does have a tendency to ramble and go on tangents during lectures, to the point where my most memorable moment from the semester was when I zoned out for a second only to see a picture of Jesus on the board and hear Elzinga talking about sheep? Most of the useful information in this class can be obtained purely by reading the textbook and paying attention in discussion. I paid fairly little attention during lecture (and took almost no notes) and still wound up with a very high A-. That being said, prior knowledge of economics if definitely very helpful, the first midterm especially is quite easy if you have a base knowledge of supply and demand. Lastly, do not rely on the dutch knockout. I did well on all three exams which really helped me out, as the cumulative curve for the semester is much, much nicer than the curve for the final only.",0,0,3.33,3,3,4,3,1
Fall 2022,12/20/22,"Lots of people talk about how they hated having Elzinga for micro, but I actually really loved Elzinga's class and would recommend taking micro with him if you can. Elzinga is a really good lecturer and tells stories that provide great context for the economic concepts he is explaining. It is important to go to lecture because he does not record class or post any slides, so if you miss the class you miss the content altogether. Doing the reading is also important, not for the midterms, but for the final exam. Some of the content in the textbook is not taught in class and vice versa. Your grade is made up clicker questions, discussion section, 2 midterms, and a final exam. The two midterms are free response style questions. Many people complained about how hard these exams were, but if you really study they are not bad at all. Very fair questions. The final exam is VERY difficult, despite being all multiple choice. Since the econ department offers dutch knockout (final exam grade only), the final exam is ridiculously hard and really brings down your average. Do not bank on dutch knockout for your grade.",0,0,4.33,4,4,5,2,4
Fall 2022,12/17/22,"I don't know what people are on with their Elzinga reviews. Professor Elzinga is genuinely one of the most engaging professors you could get. For students who want to be spoon-fed names, terms, and graphs to memorize, the lectures might seem unhelpful. But for students who want to understand economics long-term, Elzinga wastes little time explaining key concepts in a memorable and easy to follow manner. As Elzinga says, the course is really just organized common sense. Use your brain and nothing will be a challenge.",0,0,4.67,5,4,5,2,2
Fall 2022,12/16/22,"Elzinga is definitely one of the most caring and genuine professors I have had at UVA, however I think he started rambling too much in class and I could often tell during certain lectures that the class completely lost their train of thought on what he was saying.  One aspect about this class was how dependent it is on your TA.  The TA's basically make their own decisions when grading the mid terms, with mine not even following the rubric given half the time, so I would have to go to office hours with the Head TA to get it sorted out.  I ended up getting an A-, not to the help of my poor midterm grades, which is the most common grade in the class.  DO NOT listen to other reviews about the final. It is very easy to skim the textbook and pick up the facts needed to do well on the final.  I think people are just upset because he asked 2 questions that maybe required more in depth reading, but even whilst skimming the textbook I was able to gather and answer to these questions.  Take the course, with knowledge knowing that you could get screwed by your TA grading and that you are going to have to teach yourself some material that Elzinga glosses over. #tCFfall22",0,0,4.00,4,4,4,4,5
Fall 2022,12/16/22,"I loved this class. I would strongly recommend going to every lecture and actually reading the textbook and taking notes. The midterms will be more based on the lectures, but the final definitely had many concepts from the textbook that you needed to know to do well. Elzinga is a legend at UVA, and taught when my mom went here, that's how you know he's a great professor! I really enjoyed his lectures and liked the structure of the class. Grading is based on a 400 point scale accumulating clicker points, discussion section participation, and the exams, but a Dutch Knockout is used, so that if you do better on your final exam than your average, that grade will be taken as your final grade. The final grade is also curved, so I wouldn't sweat it if the first midterm doesn't go so well, because you could be looking at a good 7 point bump in the end. #tCFfall22",0,0,5.00,5,5,5,3,3
Fall 2022,12/14/22,"Kenneth Elzinga is a senile jerk who literally just wants to confuse people. You can know the material so well you can feel like you can teach the course, but NO, Elzinga makes his final exam epically impossible with the worst wording. He is NOT a legend. DO NOT TAKE CLASS WITH HIM!!!!",1,0,1.00,1,1,1,4,6
Fall 2021,1/16/22,"Do not take this class with Elzinga. I've never studied so much for a class before and still ended up with a C in the class. I read the textbook and went to every lecture to still fail every exam, not worth it. My TA also sucked and did not explain anything well. Basically had to teach myself all the material the entire semester and obviously that didn't work out.",0,0,1.33,2,1,1,5,5
Fall 2021,12/19/21,"Elzinga is a great man and a great teacher; however, there's no need to both read the textbook AND go to lecture. Yes, there is a lot that he doesn't go over in lectures that's covered in the textbook. But whatever he doesn't mention in lecture that's in the textbook can be found on Quizlet study guides made by previous students (which I recommend you look at while studying). 
Both midterms will only feature material that's covered in the lecture, but the final might have 3-5 questions that could only be answered if you read the textbook (or looked at Quizlet).
I'd say you either do one or the other, both are overkill and a waste of time. For me, I went to the lectures cause Elzinga actually makes them really interesting and enjoyable to listen to. If you want to read the textbook, then there's no need to go to lecture at all. 
All in all, Elzinga's class might be harder than other professors, but going to the lectures and hearing his jokes/examples are worth the struggle. However, if your priority is to get the best grade possible, enroll with a different professor.",0,0,4.00,5,4,3,3,2
Fall 2021,12/18/21,"I'll start off by saying that I had the pleasure to meet Elzinga in office hours and he really is the nicest man with really cool stories to tell! He is a pretty good lecturer, but I found his class to be really difficult. As someone who had never taken any sort of economics in high school, it was hard for me to absorb all the information so quickly. I also very much dislike the grading system. I'm personally not the best test taker, so hearing that the final would be worth 50% or possibly 100% (dutch knockout) of my grade was very unnerving.",1,0,3.00,4,3,2,5,2
Fall 2021,12/18/21,"Took this class as a pre-req for some prospective majors and I have a meh opinion. Reading the textbook was much more helpful than the lectures (which were often rambling and covering things you weren't sure if you should take notes on or not). What really makes or breaks your experience is your TA: I had the head TA (Anderson Frailey) which helped out a lot since he was the closest to the Professor and thus could give us better advice and help regarding what would be on the exams. The midterms (there are two) are all short-answer and aren't too bad if you read the textbook and watch the Econ minutes. However, DO NOT bank on Dutch Knockout to boost your grade: the final is full of obscure concepts and was much harder than I was expecting. Overall, if you are not a big numbers person and would prefer a more qualitative econ class, then I would choose Elzinga. If you are not bothered by more quantitive analysis, then choose Santiguni.",0,0,2.67,2,3,3,3,2
Fall 2021,12/17/21,"Anything he says in lecture is worthless. Scored a D average on the midterms so I stopped going to lectures to self study; Thoroughly reading the textbook actually helped me understand econ and I got a B+ on the final for Dutch knockout. If you actually care about your grades, his teaching style and difficult exams are not worth the extra stress.",1,0,1.33,1,1,2,3,3
Fall 2021,12/15/21,"Elzinga is the best. If you're taking Econ 201, take it with him. He is extremely knowledgeable and cares about getting to know his students and being accommodating (even though he teaches 800 students). However, if you don't have any interest in economics I feel that this wouldn't be a great option for an elective. The exams are difficult and require a lot of studying. Textbook reading is also extremely important, but I usually ended up waiting to do those until right before the exam. Discussions are also helpful for doing practice questions if you have a good TA.",1,1,5.00,5,5,5,4,3
Fall 2021,12/15/21,"DO NOT LET THE FUTURE SUIT MONKEY COMM SCHOOL GOONS CONVINCE YOU ABOUT THE NATURE OF THIS CLASS. Much of UVA deifies Kenneth Elzinga for no apparent reason. He is an interesting lecturer and normal enough dude, but the structure of his class is predatory and much harder than Econ 201 at most other schools. Midterms and TA assignments are normal/manageable enough, but the final exam is much more difficult. Though there is a curve on grades at the end of the semester, the existence of a Dutch knockout is advertised at the beginning of the semester as a realistic option in case first and second midterms are not at the desired grade. This is bs. The format of the final is 100% different than the other exams and questions are much trickier. Small details in questions and random textbook information--the same textbook with which he disagrees with multiple times in lecture and does not lecture from--are used to make the dutch knockout extremely difficult. According to my other friends who have taken this same course with Santuigini, this is still the better deal, and given that this class is required for numerous majors and schools, it may be inevitable to take it. Those of you that do take it in the future--do NOT rely on the dutch knockout/// it will come back to bite you. Any time you will save not studying for the much easier midterms will not be worth the amount of time that would be needed to study for a high grade on the final exam, which rarely anyone gets over a 93 on pre-curve. Do your due diligence.",0,0,2.33,2,3,2,4,4
Fall 2021,12/14/21,I came into this class thinking it was honestly interesting but it really wasn't at all. Sure Elzinga is very nice and has a very interesting life but his class is very confusing. His lectures are long and the graphs can get pretty confusing. It's also a very long walk to the nursing school. The textbook is interesting and I really enjoyed reading it because it gives you perspective of a lot of things but I think most of the material isn't relevant in class since Elzinga asks very tricky questions in the final. I wouldn't recommend taking this class if you're not taking a requirement.,0,0,3.00,4,3,2,4,5
Fall 2021,12/14/21,"Loved it! Workload is manageable, and consists only of a few textbook chapters throughout the semester and the occasional discussion section assignments. Lectures are not necessarily required as the bulk of the material is brought up in discussion, but they are undeniably enjoyable. Elzinga gets a lot of hate for being ambiguous at times, but it's unwarranted. Favorite class at UVA so far",0,0,5.00,5,5,5,2,1

Make sure to use Jacob Clifford to review and if you're a first-year, make sure you read that dang textbook for everything it's worth. I would definitely recommend not saving all your work for before the exam and would say that you NEED to find friends with TA's that have practice problems for you to use. If your TA is bad and you can't do anything about it then make friends with as many people as possible in order to find practice.",0,1,2.00,2,2,2,4,4
Fall 2021,12/10/21,"TAKE SANTEGINI (or however its spelled) INSTEAD. Unless you took AP ECON in hs. This class is way too much work for a decent grade. Yes, the man is well known, but you won't have a relationship with him unless you work very hard for it, so it doesn't matter. He is not a good teacher; it seems like he just goes on rants about what he finds interesting for an hour twice a week. It's unlikely that you will have a good TA, so you will have to teach the content to yourself from the textbook (it is a helpful textbook though). There is no feedback available for practice, so the exams are often a shot in the dark. Not worth it.",0,0,2.00,2,2,2,4,3
Fall 2021,12/09/21,"Elzinga is a UVA legend solely for the fact that he has taught probably 50,000 students here for over 45 years. He's kinda funny, has some interesting life stories and seems to want to get to know his students, but his lectures are not that informative, hard to pay attention to, and his PowerPoints lack content and he doesn't post them, so it is important to go to discussion and read the textbook. The tests count for so much of your grade and are not that easy since they are only short answer. It is also kinda annoying that you don't really know what you grade is until after the final due to the curve.

Fall 2021,12/09/21,"I honestly was not looking forward to this course at all because I'm not interested in econ and only took it because it was a prereq for Batten, but it honestly wasn't too bad. I definitely recommend going to lecture because Elzinga tends to emphasize whatever he thinks is important and that rarely lines up with the textbook material. The lectures correspond with certain chapters in the textbook but I would say 50% of the textbook material is completely irrelevant for the exams (at least for the two midterms - the material on the final was really random and a lot that Elzinga didn't go over). That being said, I would still read the textbook, especially before the final and/or if there is a concept you're not clear on. The only outside work for the class was to read the textbook and occasionally answer clicker questions after class. In order to get full credit for the clicker questions, you only needed to answer 15-20 correctly so you don't need to get them all right in order to get full credit. The course is graded on a 400 point scale: 15 points clicker questions, 25 points discussion section, 80 points each for two midterms, and a 200 point final exam. Elzinga also offers the Dutch knockout. The two midterms were not as hard as I expected, but all of the questions are open response which can be difficult for some people (the final exam is all multiple choice). All of the TAs will tell you not to depend on the Dutch knockout because the final scores tend to be lower than the midterm scores, but it depends on which format you're better at (the final was much harder than the two midterms this year in my opinion). Fiona Moriarty was an excellent TA, take it with her if possible!",0,0,3.00,3,3,3,2,2
Fall 2021,12/07/21,LOVED this class. Professor Elzinga is one of my favorite teachers ever and because of this class I am now seriously considering being an econ major. He clearly loves the subject matter and is very funny and engaging. 10/10 would recommend.,0,0,5.00,5,5,5,3,1
Fall 2021,12/05/21,"If you can get Justin Garrison as a TA, he is AMAZING! I felt so much better about the content after discussion each week. I didn't gain much from lecture (except for a few things that the textbook didn't cover but that my TA covered in discussion anyway). I learned 95% of the material directly from the textbook. I came in having not taken an econ class before and felt that the content you had to learn was not super difficult, but obviously certain concepts are harder than others. Clicker questions are pretty easy for the most part and didn't always correlate directly with the lecture that day so you can get away with not going to lecture. I will say that Elzinga does try to get to know his students, especially if you reach out to him, and is clearly passionate about Econ. Definitely not a bad experience, but it wasn't the amazing experience that people in the past have hyped it up to be. Even if you don't want to do econ, you learn some useful information, so I would definitely recommend it.

I had high expectations for this course and Prof. Elzinga but ultimately those fell flat. Regarding workload, the only real assignments were post-lecture quizzes, discussion attendance and quizzes, the midterms, and the final. The exams in this class are not easy and take weeks of preparation. The grading on these is not flexible and one or two slip ups can seriously tank your grade. It also doesn't help that the exams are all short answer. In order to excel in this class you need to almost perfect all of your post lecture quizzes and perform at a high level on the exams. Prof. Elzing gives you the dutch knockout option but I would not bank on it.

To be honest, I didn't find this course to be as hard as everyone says. The thing is you have to keep up with the course work and you can't cram right before the tests. The two midterms are very memorization based in my opinion, and the best thing to do is memorize all the vocabulary words. The final was a little easier because it's multiple choice, but you should really study everything well and have no gaps in your knowledge. IMO, as long as you put in the work, this should be an A.

Luckily I have prior experience in econ so I still found the class to be relatively easy, but it can definitely be annoying at times if it's your first econ class. Don't be scared of the class though because the curve is INSANELY forgiving. Elzinga is a great lecturer and his econ minutes were great (rip Ollie).

I think the one of most important things in this class is having a good TA who can help you interpret the dull lectures and textbook concepts. My TA wasn't the best...at all. The midterms are both short answer, however I found myself more confused by the questions at times than the actual class content. Some questions were real life situations that asked to be related to economics, but gave little to no context about which concept it was supposed to be applied to. It did not help that the answer key was very strict and left little room for interpretation. The final exam was multiple choice, and despite studying for hours, taking the practice final, and watching multiple YouTube videos to prepare, I still got a D...which turned into a C- thanks to the curve (thank god) because the questions were purposely worded in a confusing way.

The tests and grades, on the other hand, are a totally different story. The two tests are all in short-answers which have very strict grading rules, detailed into specific wordings. If you explained the concept in a different format from the key, you are likely to be taken points off which,  in most of cases, are full points. The other thing is that this class is based on percentiles rather than scores, which means that you would not know your actual grades for the previous two test until final.

He was a dry and boring lecturer and I often found his worldview very outdated (granted, he is rather old). The TAs are told to be extremely nit-picky when grading the two midterms which was extremely frustrating when you would get zero points on a 6 point question because you used a word in one of your definitions that was a synonym of the word they would've used.

He's extremely knowledgeable in economics and is considered an expert in the field, though that has its drawbacks since he missed like 3 lectures this semester because he had to testify on various court cases. In lecture you complete clicker questions and he sometimes tells you that there will be some in the next class but not always, so I'd recommend going to every lecture until you get the 15 points for the clicker questions. That being said, he fills his exams with seemingly random concepts or facts that aren't mentioned in the textbook, so if you want to do well on the exams you should go to lecture and pay attention, though it's sometimes extremely hard due to the size of the class and his lectures are usually on the boring side. You also NEED to read the textbook since Elzinga brushes over actual foundational economics in lecture in favor of the content he wants to teach. I personally enjoyed the textbook and it's much more in-depth than Elzinga's lectures. If you go to lecture and keep up with reading you will probably get an A or A-. The exams are straightforward if you do the work, and the exam averages are pretty low (since most people don't do the work) so if you keep on top of the class the curve at the end will definitely benefit you.

I didn't like his lecture style because he would take way too long to get to the point and he would never upload notes or material that he went through in his lecture. Since the lecture hall was so big, it was easy to zone out -- one of the only reasons I was able to follow along with the course was because my amazing TA (Gabriela Busche) made her own Powerpoints and uploaded practice questions compiled from other TAs. The second test was harder than the first test, but I found the final pretty easy and I only studied the day before.

Strongly recommend keeping up with all the reading as the textbook is essential to doing well and thoroughly explains concepts that aren't necessarily discussed in lecture in a very coherent way. A lot of people have complained about the online Connect resource and don't like it, but I found it to be very helpful. The practice portion of connect provides multiple choice and fill in the blank questions for every chapter and was really helpful for checking how well I knew a certain portion of the material. Elzinga IS a legend; don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. With a class this huge, some people are bound to not like it, but I really felt like I got a lot out of every lecture. His anecdotes/obvious economic skill AND the attempts he makes to appeal to other subject areas really made for an interesting class, instead of having a teacher that drilled us on basic concepts for 55 minutes twice a week––that's what your TA is for. John Fry was an awesome TA for this course and always let us know what was coming next (quizzes, homework, etc.). The scale Elzinga creates for grades is very forgiving and you'll probably end up doing a lot better than you thought you were doing because of it.

That aside, taking this course was a horrible experience for me because I ended up not having that much of an interest in econ, in fact, I think I came to hate econ more after taking this course lol. I thought that Econ would be a pretty useful course to take and since it fulfills one of the gen ed requirements for the College, I was like why not? If you have similar thoughts like me, STOP. Don’t take econ unless you are REALLY interested in it, on the pre-comm track, or took econ before in high school. Elzinga’s lectures are huge and he doesn’t even cover what’s on the test half of the time; you’ll have to consult the textbook for that. However, he does try to make his lectures more interesting with examples but ultimately, he just focuses on the concepts and not on the say, graphs or equations you’re supposed to remember for the test. Clicker questions aren’t every class, and you only have to get 15 clicker points to get full credit so you don’t really have to attend lecture that much. 
Also, I picked Ergene as my TA for the discussion and while his quizzes are hard, he posts multiple problem sets and their answers and that’s more than I can say other TAs do lol. 
The exams really killed me though. Although it’s free-response, they are graded quite harshly.

He has a good sense of humor to keep the class engaged throughout the lecture, and purposely keeps the class shorter than the allotted time because, well, he does not need it all.

Elzinga teaches from an overhead projector (something I had not seen since elementary school) and uses a â€œpegsâ€ sheet to cover each lecture.  This made it difficult to have a thorough understanding of each lecture and he often summarized major points and simplified them, which made you think you understood the material, but when you read the textbook there was a lot of information he did not cover.  The grading system is a somewhat a guessing game too.  As previously mentioned in the posts below, he does the Dutch Knockout, but does not give a letter grade for midterms.  If you do better than the average it is a good thing, but you have no idea what the average is letter-grade wise.

Fall 2012,12/21/12,"If you just want to take an Economics class but aren't Pre-Comm/Econ Major, take Professor Coppock's class in the spring.
Professor Elzinga is an incredibly intelligent professor, and he's very open to meeting with students after class or during his office hours. However, I found his lectures to be sometimes a bit dry and simplified. He explains things well over-all, but a lack of structure sometimes made them hard to follow. Unlike Coppock, Elzinga does not use any kind of bullet points while he speaks. This can sometimes make it a little difficult to write down the ""most important"" points of information. Reading the textbook will definitely supplement the lecture, even if the book is pretty dry.
Tests were sometimes unnecessarily tricky, and it seemed like Elzinga purposely wrote his questions with the intent to trick students. For the most part, they weren't overly difficult, and if you read the textbook and go to lecture, you shouldn't have much difficulty. TA grading seemed sometimes subjective for the ""explain"" questions. If you don't like your TA on the first day, switch out. A TA that can explain concepts well is an incredible asset. Bingjie was nice, but discussions were not helpful in the slightest.
Final is not too hard. Some of the questions were ridiculously simple, and others actually tested application of your knowledge. His practice exam was very helpful. His Dutch Knockout can be helpful if you mess up a test early on, but don't rely on it. Based on Coppock's grade cut offs (Elzinga never posted them), you had to do better % wise on the final than in the class as a whole.

What many people who review this course don't seem to realize is that by taking this class, the most significant thing you gain access to is Elzinga's vast supply of human capital. That's what can make this class so worthwhile and life changing - you just have to go to office hours for it, which I would highly recommend. General Course Information: 1) graded out of 400 or 200 points a) the 400 point option is two 80 point tests, 20 points from discussion quizzes, 20 points from clicker questions in lecture, and 200 points for the final b) the 200 point option is known as the ""Dutch Knockout,"" in it your final exam grade is doubled and taken as your entire course grade. 2) my TA was not hard to understand in the slightest. I would say the TAs aren't that necessary, but just something the school does for such a large class to keep student to faculty ratios low. I'm not sure if it is just people not doing as well as they expected and trying to blame it on someone or if some of them are actually bad. 3) Geng's test score average was always about 6 points higher than the class average, so either his sections were actually smarter, or he was an easier grader. 4) the final exam is not nearly as difficult as people seem to make it out to be. Basically consists of either very basic ideas/concepts/definitions questions (which you don't need to study for) and more difficult ""how well you can think about things you have learned throughout the course"" questions (which you truly cannot study for).

The clicker questions were a joke- I've yet to miss one, but hey, easy points, right?  But Elzinga is brilliant and amazing.  He is such an amusing individual- the class as a whole laughs frequently and genuinely, not forced for the sake of the teacher liking them.  Some people complained about how he starts and finishes a bit early for lecture and therefore ""doesn't use his time well"", but I've yet to see a need for the additional ten minutes or so that he usually cuts off.  He assigns very little work at all, your grades are almost entirely based on the tests, which I didn't find to be as bad as everyone else was describing.  Elzinga makes economics applicable, interesting, and fun.  Highly recommended, fantastic teacher.
Side ntoe: The mandatory discussion annoyed the hell out of me because I found it totally redundant and unnecessary, but Zach Moller is pretty good (can't really spell or write well but that's negligible), definitely not the worst I'd seen (I had to transfer out of Danila Panikov's session- he was horrid).",0,0,5.00,5,5,5,1,0

Anyway, read the book, it's not tough and isn't as dry as most. His lectures are great and covers it all, but I would still read.
Christine Stec was a great TA. She isn't the best at coming up with creative examples, but she will still convey the concepts well if you come with questions.
The tests/quizzes were super easy. You should be ashamed if you don't get an A in this class.
Don't forget to bring your clicker for the meeting of the clicker club.
I really though Econ changed the way I look at the world. I now look at everything in terms of opportunity costs and tradeoffs. It really does give you a different mindset. And I think that's what a great class does.",0,0,5.00,5,5,5,2,4
