Doing the reading is also important, not for the midterms, but for the final exam. Some of the content in the textbook is not taught in class and vice versa. Your grade is made up clicker questions, discussion section, 2 midterms, and a final exam. The two midterms are free response style questions. Many people complained about how hard these exams were, but if you really study they are not bad at all. Very fair questions. The final exam is VERY difficult, despite being all multiple choice.

The TA's basically make their own decisions when grading the mid terms, with mine not even following the rubric given half the time, so I would have to go to office hours with the Head TA to get it sorted out.  I ended up getting an A-, not to the help of my poor midterm grades, which is the most common grade in the class.  DO NOT listen to other reviews about the final. It is very easy to skim the textbook and pick up the facts needed to do well on the final.  I think people are just upset because he asked 2 questions that maybe required more in depth reading, but even whilst skimming the textbook I was able to gather and answer to these questions.

Both midterms will only feature material that's covered in the lecture, but the final might have 3-5 questions that could only be answered if you read the textbook (or looked at Quizlet).
I'd say you either do one or the other, both are overkill and a waste of time. For me, I went to the lectures cause Elzinga actually makes them really interesting and enjoyable to listen to. If you want to read the textbook, then there's no need to go to lecture at all.

Though there is a curve on grades at the end of the semester, the existence of a Dutch knockout is advertised at the beginning of the semester as a realistic option in case first and second midterms are not at the desired grade. This is bs. The format of the final is 100% different than the other exams and questions are much trickier. Small details in questions and random textbook information--the same textbook with which he disagrees with multiple times in lecture and does not lecture from--are used to make the dutch knockout extremely difficult. According to my other friends who have taken this same course with Santuigini, this is still the better deal, and given that this class is required for numerous majors and schools, it may be inevitable to take it. Those of you that do take it in the future--do NOT rely on the dutch knockout/// it will come back to bite you.

I definitely recommend going to lecture because Elzinga tends to emphasize whatever he thinks is important and that rarely lines up with the textbook material. The lectures correspond with certain chapters in the textbook but I would say 50% of the textbook material is completely irrelevant for the exams (at least for the two midterms - the material on the final was really random and a lot that Elzinga didn't go over). That being said, I would still read the textbook, especially before the final and/or if there is a concept you're not clear on. The only outside work for the class was to read the textbook and occasionally answer clicker questions after class. In order to get full credit for the clicker questions, you only needed to answer 15-20 correctly so you don't need to get them all right in order to get full credit. The course is graded on a 400 point scale: 15 points clicker questions, 25 points discussion section, 80 points each for two midterms, and a 200 point final exam. Elzinga also offers the Dutch knockout. The two midterms were not as hard as I expected, but all of the questions are open response which can be difficult for some people (the final exam is all multiple choice).

TCF,"Take this class with Elzinga! I want to do politics/Batten/PPL so needed the pre-req and actually learned a ton. It's not easy though. Tests require intense studying and are very picky/specific. On one test, I gave the write definition except for one word and got the entire question wrong. It's also based on a curve (kind of) so it's hard to predict your score but it is compared to the average. For example, I got an A- for the class with 336/400 points for the semester so your grade will be higher than the percentage value.  Despite the specific and tricky tests, I did fine with no previous econ experience and decent studying for the exams. Read the textbook (it's like 1/4 of the class and some of it is never mentioned in lecture). But definitely take it. I've heard Santiguini (or the other guy who teaches it in the fall) is easier but it's more math-based...",0.8625,0.11,0.831,0.059,0.8625
TCF,"I love everything about this course other than the test. All the contents Professor Elzinga taught were useful and he explained in a way that we could apply the lessons we learned to real-world situations. Besides that, Elzinga is also  such a sweet character and live up to his reputation on ground.
The tests and grades, on the other hand, are a totally different story. The two tests are all in short-answers which have very strict grading rules, detailed into specific wordings. If you explained the concept in a different format from the key, you are likely to be taken points off which,  in most of cases, are full points. The other thing is that this class is based on percentiles rather than scores, which means that you would not know your actual grades for the previous two test until final. The final is even more ""impossible"" with 75 MCs encompassing every details he mentioned in class, textbooks, and the required reading.

I specifically took this course with Elzinga because he is so well known around Grounds and so many people told me I had to take it with him. Honestly, I don't see the big hype around him. He was a dry and boring lecturer and I often found his worldview very outdated (granted, he is rather old). The TAs are told to be extremely nit-picky when grading the two midterms which was extremely frustrating when you would get zero points on a 6 point question because you used a word in one of your definitions that was a synonym of the word they would've used. The final was unnecessarily tricky. Elzinga was honestly the worst professor I had this semester. He does not live up to the hype. My TA was good though.",0.4851,0.092,0.836,0.072,0.4851

He is extremely knowledgeable in the economics field and has been teaching this course the same way for generations (literally-- the parents of some people in our lecture took it with him) . In my opinion, taking this class with Professor Elzinga is a rite of passage for any UVa student. Lectures are interesting and entertaining, but it is definitely necessary to do the supplemental textbook readings to succeed in the class.

TCF,"Elzinga is probably the only ""celebrity"" professor at UVA and he's a super nice guy. He tried to get to know the students that go to his office hours or ask him questions after class or email him. He's extremely knowledgeable in economics and is considered an expert in the field, though that has its drawbacks since he missed like 3 lectures this semester because he had to testify on various court cases. In lecture you complete clicker questions and he sometimes tells you that there will be some in the next class but not always, so I'd recommend going to every lecture until you get the 15 points for the clicker questions. That being said, he fills his exams with seemingly random concepts or facts that aren't mentioned in the textbook, so if you want to do well on the exams you should go to lecture and pay attention, though it's sometimes extremely hard due to the size of the class and his lectures are usually on the boring side. You also NEED to read the textbook since Elzinga brushes over actual foundational economics in lecture in favor of the content he wants to teach. I personally enjoyed the textbook and it's much more in-depth than Elzinga's lectures. If you go to lecture and keep up with reading you will probably get an A or A-. The exams are straightforward if you do the work, and the exam averages are pretty low (since most people don't do the work) so if you keep on top of the class the curve at the end will definitely benefit you.

TCF,"Honestly, I don't get all the hype about Professor Elzinga - he's a funny guy, but his lectures weren't as mindblowing and magical as everyone made them out to be. I didn't like his lecture style because he would take way too long to get to the point and he would never upload notes or material that he went through in his lecture. Since the lecture hall was so big, it was easy to zone out -- one of the only reasons I was able to follow along with the course was because my amazing TA (Gabriela Busche) made her own Powerpoints and uploaded practice questions compiled from other TAs. The second test was harder than the first test, but I found the final pretty easy and I only studied the day before. DON'T rely on Dutch Knockout for your grade, since the curve for the 400 point grade was much better than the curve for the 200 point grade this semester. If you can't focus during lectures, reading the textbook is definitely a must, but I don't think it's necessary to purchase the Connect access card for extra problems if you want a good grade.

I'd also recommend going to office hours, both Mr. Elzinga's and your TA's. If the TA you end up with isn't helpful, go to the head TA instead. Being able to ask questions and talk about what I missed on quizzes and tests was invaluable to me. The second test was much harder for me than the first one, but I think a lot of the points I lost were due to rushing, and not taking the time to read each question very carefully.

Unlike a lot of other college classes where you're heading into the exam not really knowing what the test is going to look like, this class is more like a high school class in that you have all the information before you heading into the exam and just really need to grind to do well. Strongly recommend keeping up with all the reading as the textbook is essential to doing well and thoroughly explains concepts that aren't necessarily discussed in lecture in a very coherent way. A lot of people have complained about the online Connect resource and don't like it, but I found it to be very helpful. The practice portion of connect provides multiple choice and fill in the blank questions for every chapter and was really helpful for checking how well I knew a certain portion of the material. Elzinga IS a legend; don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. With a class this huge, some people are bound to not like it, but I really felt like I got a lot out of every lecture. His anecdotes/obvious economic skill AND the attempts he makes to appeal to other subject areas really made for an interesting class, instead of having a teacher that drilled us on basic concepts for 55 minutes twice a week––that's what your TA is for. John Fry was an awesome TA for this course and always let us know what was coming next (quizzes, homework, etc.). The scale Elzinga creates for grades is very forgiving and you'll probably end up doing a lot better than you thought you were doing because of it.

Plus the final grade distribution is based on a curve of the average, so even if you did poorly on an exam, the curve can help you as long as you're above the average. A lot of people also complain that Elzinga does not cover all of the exam material in his lectures. Elzinga will tell everyone specifically at the beginning of the semester that he expects students to supplement lectures with readings from the textbook.

That aside, taking this course was a horrible experience for me because I ended up not having that much of an interest in econ, in fact, I think I came to hate econ more after taking this course lol. I thought that Econ would be a pretty useful course to take and since it fulfills one of the gen ed requirements for the College, I was like why not? If you have similar thoughts like me, STOP. Don’t take econ unless you are REALLY interested in it, on the pre-comm track, or took econ before in high school. Elzinga’s lectures are huge and he doesn’t even cover what’s on the test half of the time; you’ll have to consult the textbook for that. However, he does try to make his lectures more interesting with examples but ultimately, he just focuses on the concepts and not on the say, graphs or equations you’re supposed to remember for the test. Clicker questions aren’t every class, and you only have to get 15 clicker points to get full credit so you don’t really have to attend lecture that much. 
Also, I picked Ergene as my TA for the discussion and while his quizzes are hard, he posts multiple problem sets and their answers and that’s more than I can say other TAs do lol. 
The exams really killed me though. Although it’s free-response, they are graded quite harshly. If you do want to take this class, be sure to be up-to-date on all the reading and do as many practice problems as you can. Also visit Elzinga’s office hours and talk to him because he’s a cool guy.

Even though his lectures don't explain some of the calculations and graphs you're expected to know, the textbook he uses does a really good job.

He's pretty funny if you have a good sense of humor, and his lectures were informative and enjoyable.

Performed slightly above average on both, but somehow ended up with an A-. I think that was from the dutch knockout.  Also pay attention and take advantage of your discussion section.

The curve in this class is very unforgiving and the exams are all very challenging, even if you put in the time to study.

Elzinga's lectures are packed with hundreds of students, which makes it incredibly difficult to follow along and to pay attention.

TCF,"I went into this class with high expectations and I was a bit disappointed.  Elzinga teaches from an overhead projector (something I had not seen since elementary school) and uses a â€œpegsâ€ sheet to cover each lecture.  This made it difficult to have a thorough understanding of each lecture and he often summarized major points and simplified them, which made you think you understood the material, but when you read the textbook there was a lot of information he did not cover.  The grading system is a somewhat a guessing game too.  As previously mentioned in the posts below, he does the Dutch Knockout, but does not give a letter grade for midterms.  If you do better than the average it is a good thing, but you have no idea what the average is letter-grade wise.  If you do not have a problem with large class lecture learning then I would recommend this class, but if you do I would look into a smaller economics class taught by a T.A.

Elzinga curves your final raw point total (out of 400) or gives you your raw final exam score, whichever is higher, as your final average, so it's hard to know how you're doing throughout the semester.",0.8854,0.151,0.802,0.047,0.8854
TCF,"If you just want to take an Economics class but aren't Pre-Comm/Econ Major, take Professor Coppock's class in the spring.
Professor Elzinga is an incredibly intelligent professor, and he's very open to meeting with students after class or during his office hours. However, I found his lectures to be sometimes a bit dry and simplified. He explains things well over-all, but a lack of structure sometimes made them hard to follow. Unlike Coppock, Elzinga does not use any kind of bullet points while he speaks. This can sometimes make it a little difficult to write down the ""most important"" points of information. Reading the textbook will definitely supplement the lecture, even if the book is pretty dry.
Tests were sometimes unnecessarily tricky, and it seemed like Elzinga purposely wrote his questions with the intent to trick students. For the most part, they weren't overly difficult, and if you read the textbook and go to lecture, you shouldn't have much difficulty. TA grading seemed sometimes subjective for the ""explain"" questions. If you don't like your TA on the first day, switch out. A TA that can explain concepts well is an incredible asset. Bingjie was nice, but discussions were not helpful in the slightest.
Final is not too hard. Some of the questions were ridiculously simple, and others actually tested application of your knowledge. His practice exam was very helpful. His Dutch Knockout can be helpful if you mess up a test early on, but don't rely on it. Based on Coppock's grade cut offs (Elzinga never posted them), you had to do better % wise on the final than in the class as a whole. If you have to take Introduction to Micro, take it with Elzinga, but his class wasn't as incredible as some make it out to be.",0.947,0.132,0.772,0.096,0.947

TCF,"Elzinga chooses to lecture to the lowest common denominator but gladly takes questions about tangent topics after class (and can answer them with great insight). What many people who review this course don't seem to realize is that by taking this class, the most significant thing you gain access to is Elzinga's vast supply of human capital. That's what can make this class so worthwhile and life changing - you just have to go to office hours for it, which I would highly recommend. General Course Information: 1) graded out of 400 or 200 points a) the 400 point option is two 80 point tests, 20 points from discussion quizzes, 20 points from clicker questions in lecture, and 200 points for the final b) the 200 point option is known as the ""Dutch Knockout,"" in it your final exam grade is doubled and taken as your entire course grade. 2) my TA was not hard to understand in the slightest. I would say the TAs aren't that necessary, but just something the school does for such a large class to keep student to faculty ratios low. I'm not sure if it is just people not doing as well as they expected and trying to blame it on someone or if some of them are actually bad. 3) Geng's test score average was always about 6 points higher than the class average, so either his sections were actually smarter, or he was an easier grader. 4) the final exam is not nearly as difficult as people seem to make it out to be. Basically consists of either very basic ideas/concepts/definitions questions (which you don't need to study for) and more difficult ""how well you can think about things you have learned throughout the course"" questions (which you truly cannot study for).

Some of the questions on exams are directly from his lectures, so its helpful to actually listen to lectures while you are at UVA instead of lying in bed or skipping class. There is really no reason to be late for a 11:00 or 12:30 lecture anyway. First two exams were relatively straight-forward and fair. By no means were the exams SOOOOOOO EASY. Some questions were, but others weren't. Final was definitely hard and my grade dropped from an A+ before the final, to a B+ after the final. So I don't really know what happened, even though I knew the material, or at least I thought I did. But if you came to UVA to take classes that are ""Easy A's"", then transfer out of UVA, you can't get through 4 years of UVA without encountering any difficult course. Bottom line is just read the book and listen to his lectures. If you do that, the midterm exams will be a fair representation of your knowledge.

Not very difficult; basically a semester long on supply and demand; Elzinga is more of a philosopher than an economist in this class.. he tells you how to get rich, what beers are popular, and why the Comm School is not as cool as the Economics Dept.
